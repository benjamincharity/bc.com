## If Everyone Owns It, No One Owns It

You've conducted a brilliant post-mortem. The team identified three systemic issues and brainstormed five concrete improvements. Everyone nods enthusiastically about the action items. Three months later, the same incident happens again, and you realize none of the fixes were actually implemented.

This execution gap is where most post-mortem programs fail. Even when teams identify valuable insights and concrete improvements, follow-through often falters. Without clear ownership and systematic tracking, action items disappear into backlogs, and the underlying vulnerabilities remain.

The brutal reality: Less than 50% of organizations have mature incident learning processes with consistent follow-through. Those that do enjoy substantially fewer repeat outages.[²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-2) The completion gap is what separates incremental learning from real resilience.

## Why Action Items Die

Understanding why follow-ups fail is crucial to fixing the process:

### The Action Item Void

Atlassian calls this the "action item void": the black hole where good intentions go to die. Google's SRE documentation describes it as creating "unvirtuous cycles of unclosed postmortems" when organizations reward writing reports but not completing the associated fixes.[¹¹](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-11)

This execution gap is widely recognized across the industry. **Subpar postmortems with incomplete action items make incident recurrence far more likely**, and action items without clear owners are significantly less likely to be resolved.[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10)

### Two Fatal Patterns

#### Vague Ownership
Actions like "investigate X" or "add monitoring for Y" get assigned to a team or left unassigned. When everyone owns it, no one owns it. Without a single accountable person, the task never happens.

#### No Deadlines or Follow-up
In many organizations, there's no defined timeline for post-mortem fixes. Teams move on to new project work, and incident action items get deprioritized indefinitely. One report notes that teams had to implement strict 4- or 8-week SLOs for completing "priority actions" to ensure these fixes weren't endlessly postponed.[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10)

### The Vicious Cycle

The result is predictable: the same incident (or a closely related one) will recur because the underlying vulnerability remains. Meanwhile, leadership has a false sense of security because there's a nice post-mortem document filed away.

This is perhaps the biggest failure mode in post-incident programs.

## How Leading Teams Ensure Follow-Through

Elite organizations have cracked the code on action accountability through systematic approaches:

### Assign Clear Ownership

Every single action item from a post-mortem gets assigned to an individual owner (with their agreement), not to a group or left as "TBD." That person is accountable for driving completion or escalating issues.

Atlassian's approach: They track all post-mortem follow-up tasks in Jira, linking them to the incident ticket, with an assignee for each.[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10) This avoids the diffusion of responsibility that plagues many follow-ups.

Why individuals matter: Personal accountability creates ownership. When someone's name is on a task, they're more likely to drive it to completion or raise blockers early.

### Set Realistic Deadlines and SLOs

Not all fixes are equal. Some might be quick (adding a missing alert), others might require multi-sprint projects (re-architecting part of a system). Set target deadlines appropriate to the size and priority:

- **Small fixes:** 2-week deadlines
- **Medium improvements:** 4-8 weeks with milestones
- **Large projects:** Break into phases with concrete deliverables

Atlassian's framework: They designate "Priority 1 actions" that must be completed within 4 or 8 weeks depending on severity, with actual reporting on these deadlines.[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10)

The goal isn't micro-management but ensuring improvements don't slip into "someday." If an action will take longer than a couple of months, break it into phases or make it a formal project.

### Build Tracking and Reminder Systems

What mechanism ensures the team doesn't forget? This can be lightweight but must be consistent:

#### Monthly Review Cadence
Some teams set up an "Incident Action Item Kanban" visible to engineering leads and review it in staff meetings every two weeks. This creates gentle peer pressure to complete tasks and allows raising blockers.

#### Automated Reminders
Many companies automate periodic Slack reminders about open post-mortem tasks. Atlassian built custom reporting from Jira to see how many incidents still have open "priority actions," with managers reviewing that list regularly.[¹¹](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-11)

#### Executive Visibility
**Measure it and it will improve.** If leadership tracks "action item closure rate" as a key metric, teams are more likely to follow through. High-performing teams treat that closure rate as seriously as uptime or velocity.

### Secure Executive Buy-In

This is a force multiplier. When senior leaders (director, VP, CTO) regularly read post-mortems and ask about follow-up status, it signals this work is truly important.

Google's approach: SRE leaders note that management's active participation in postmortem reviews and follow-up is crucial to reinforce the culture.[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5) In practice, this might mean:
- A senior leader chairs post-mortem reviews for major incidents
- Executives add comments like "The database timeout fix looks critical. Do you need help getting database team bandwidth?"
- Public recognition for team members who implement major preventive fixes

**When the top sets the tone that reliability improvements are first-class work (not "maintenance chores"), engineers make time for it.**

### Keep Actions Concrete and Achievable

Ensure actions are specific and within the team's scope. Avoid vague suggestions or aspirational goals that everyone knows won't happen.

- **Instead of:** "Consider doing X" or "100% test coverage"
- **Use:** "Evaluate X tool and present findings by [date]" or "Add tests for modules A, B (which caused this outage)"

This makes accountability clear. If something is truly a nice-to-have that likely won't get resources, don't list it: or put it in a separate "future ideas" section.

## The Systematic Approach

Here's how to build action accountability into your process:

### During the Post-Mortem Meeting

1. **Brainstorm improvements** for each root cause identified
2. **Prioritize ruthlessly** using impact vs. effort or risk reduction potential
3. **Assign owners** for each action item during the meeting
4. **Set deadlines** based on scope and priority
5. **Document everything** in your tracking system before the meeting ends

### After the Meeting

1. **Create tracking tickets** in your project management system
2. **Set calendar reminders** for deadline check-ins
3. **Add to team dashboards** so progress is visible
4. **Schedule follow-up meetings** if needed for complex items

### Monthly Reviews

1. **Review all open items** with engineering leadership
2. **Identify blockers** and escalate if needed
3. **Celebrate completions** and their impact
4. **Adjust processes** based on what's working/not working

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to ensure your accountability system works:

### Completion Metrics
- **Action item closure rate** (aim for >80% within SLO)
- **Average time to completion** (trending downward)
- **Percentage of overdue items** (minimize this)

### Outcome Metrics
- **Repeat incident rate** (should decrease as fixes accumulate)
- **Time to resolution** (should improve as systems get more robust)
- **Team satisfaction** with the follow-up process

## Common Accountability Failures

### The "Everything is High Priority" Trap
If every action item is marked urgent, nothing gets the attention it deserves. Use a clear prioritization framework and accept that some improvements will wait.

### The "We'll Get to It Next Sprint" Syndrome
Without explicit deadlines and tracking, "next sprint" becomes "never." Build accountability into your existing sprint planning process.

### The "Perfect Solution" Paralysis
Don't let the pursuit of perfect fixes prevent good incremental improvements. A quick monitoring alert is better than no alert while you design the perfect observability strategy.

## Business Impact of Strong Accountability

Organizations with systematic action item tracking and completion see:

- **Significantly fewer repeat incidents** compared to teams with poor follow-through[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10).
- **Accumulated institutional knowledge** and resilience over time.
- **Higher team morale** as engineers see their effort resulting in tangible improvements.
- **Customer trust** through demonstrated commitment to reliability.

As Google acknowledges, continuous postmortem investment results in fewer outages over time and better user experiences.[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5) **Robust action follow-through pays off in reliability and customer trust.**

## Implementation Quick Start

1. **Add ownership and deadlines** to your current post-mortem template.
2. **Create a simple tracking dashboard** (even a shared spreadsheet works initially).
3. **Set monthly review cadence** with engineering leadership.
4. **Celebrate early wins** when action items prevent future incidents.
5. **Iterate and improve** the process based on team feedback.
