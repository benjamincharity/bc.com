Data tables are certainly one of the most complex UI features to implement. **Because of this complexity, it is very easy miss requirements and also very costly to refactor.** The list of questions below has been slowly built out over many years and several data-table implementations across varying companies. It is meant to assist with the initial discovery phase and help to align the expectations of all stakeholders.

> Note: We lightly discuss the topics of searching and filtering data and keyboard controls below. They could easily
> both be their own lists due to how complex each topic is.

## Data

-   How should large datasets be handled?
    -   Pagination

            -   Should this setting be restored when the application is reloaded?
            -   Should this be a view-level setting or an application-level setting?
    -   Virtual scroll (data is dynamically loaded and removed as the user scrolls through the content)
    -   Infinite scroll or lazy loading (more data is loaded as the user reaches the bottom)
    -   Showing dynamic messaging to encourage the user to filter the data more aggressively.
-   How should empty states be handled?

        -   No data was returned due to an error
-   Should the display of data change for specific users or roles?
    -   e.g., An admin role may have different graphs or summaries compared to a basic user.

    -   Is the filter column-specific or applied to the entire table?
    -   Should all columns be filterable?
    -   Can more than one column be filtered at the same time?
    -   Are there any possible data points that the user _cannot_ filter by?
    -   Can the table be filtered on a global level as well?
    -   How should the search be executed?
        -   Explicit match

    -   Should query results highlighted?
        -   Should it be highlighted at the row level, cell level or both?

    -   Note: We consider it a 'search' when the query requests data from the server and a 'filter' when the query
        narrows a data-set.
