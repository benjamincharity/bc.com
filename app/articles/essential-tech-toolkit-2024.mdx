### **Hardware**

- **Monitor:** [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/) Curved 49-inch - Pro tip: I‚Äôve found that for _very_ wide screens, it can help to position it a little lower than usual and then tilt it slightly up.
- **Webcam:** [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/) - I‚Äôve tried many different webcams looking for a great picture, etc. Even so far as to buy a Canon M50 and a good lens. But none have been so easy to use as the Insta360. The tracking is a nice feature in casual settings. Whiteboard mode is excellent for remote work.
- **Desk:** [Uplift Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/) - Uplift motorized standing/sitting desk with a whiteboard top. I should have done the whiteboard desk much sooner. It is very convenient.

### **Things I‚Äôm Going to Stop Using**

- **Window Manager:** [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) - While it is fantastic, I like the simplicity of Divvy. It is as fast to use in almost all of my use cases and only requires a single shortcut. Historically, I‚Äôve always had a bunch of keyboard shortcuts for window management, but as my monitor continually grows, so do my desired configurations.
- **Snippet Management:** [Cacher](https://www.cacher.io/) - As AI and intelligent autocomplete become more prevalent, I no longer use a dedicated snippet manager.
- **Keep Computer Awake:** [KeepingYouAwake](https://keepingyouawake.app/) - Switching to Lungo since it is from the same developer as Dato.

That's the rundown of my current toolkit as we navigate the tech landscape of 2024. I hope you find some gems that fit seamlessly into your workflow or inspire a fresh approach. Here's to efficient and inspired working in the year ahead! üçæ üöÄ
