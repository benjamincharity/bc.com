Recently a project I was working on required the ability to URL-encode various strings in order to create `mailTo:`
links on the fly. Because more than one of our modules needed this ability, I decided to create a simple
component to share the code between modules.

This is dead simple thanks to JavaScript's `encodeURI` and `decodeURI`. Take a look:

<iframe
  className={'w-full border-0'}
  src="https://embed.plnkr.co/oPJZWt/?show=preview"
  allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"
></iframe>

Feel free to [grab it on GitHub][gh] or [offer any improvements][issues].
