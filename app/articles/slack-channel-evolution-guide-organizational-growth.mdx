Welcome to the dynamic journey of organizational growth! As we embark on this
adventure, it’s essential to remember that the path we’re outlining is a broad
blueprint, not a one-size-fits-all roadmap. Every company is unique, with its
own set of experiences and milestones. While we provide approximate employee
counts as signposts, they serve more as a guide than a rigid framework, helping
us anticipate and plan for the evolving needs of our organization.

**Early adoption of a structured approach is key. By establishing a clear
organizational framework from the start, we can avoid the complexities of
restructuring and renaming down the line.** This proactive planning isn’t just
about maintaining order and empowerment. When our team understands the structure
of our company information, they gain clarity and confidence. They become better
equipped to recognize when a new channel is needed and how to effectively
organize it, ensuring that our communication remains as streamlined and
efficient as our operations.

As we grow and scale, **this structure will be our backbone, supporting us in
adapting to change, embracing new challenges, and seizing opportunities with
agility and insight.**

## Founding

During this phase, most activities are conducted within three communication
channels. While some individuals might opt for a single-channel approach at this
point, it is challenging if there's a strict policy of consistently utilizing
threads. In the initial stages, I frequently engage in multiple simultaneous
conversations, and managing notifications becomes more convenient in this
manner. Here, you can begin to discern the initial elements of our
organizational structure.

- `#general`
- `#dept-product`
- `#dept-cs`

## Startup

_5-50 people_

We need to create more department-specific and general information channels at
this stage. With our growing team, we can also introduce some fun channels
dedicated to pets and trips.

Setting up a leadership channel for each department is crucial now. These
channels significantly shape how we work and the culture we build as a company.

As our projects involve people from different teams, we're starting to use
temporary, project-specific channels. We're also changing how we handle
production incidents. We now have a starting point for any incident and a
structured way to create channels for each incident type. We've added a new bot
prefix to help manage automated notifications from different sources like
deployments, support, and marketing.

**It's important to encourage everyone to mute channels by default as we move
forward.** You can jump into a channel if you want to, but you won't get
constant notifications for every message. This helps us stay focused.

To keep things organized, use pins and channel info to store important
information like who's in charge of a channel and links to relevant team or
project documents.

Consider using an asynchronous check-in process. If we don't have a dedicated
tool for it, we can use Slack automation to facilitate weekly and daily
check-ins. This will help us stay on top of project updates and priorities.

- `#dept-people-ops` - A channel for HR-related teams and talk.
- `#dept-eng` At this point, it is time to split from product to help keep
  conversations focused
- `#dept-marketing` - Around this time, it's beneficial to provide a space for
  those managing marketing roles, even if you don't have a dedicated team.
- `#fun-furry-friends` - Pets!
- `#fun-trips` - Celebrate time off and don’t limit it to vacations. Even a day
  trip counts!
- Project-specific channels - `#proj-sso`
- `#leadership-panel` - for the leaders of each department
- `#fun-hobbies` - Everything from underwater soap carving to competitive
  knitting.
- `#situation-room` - Where people convene when things go wrong.
- Incident response channels - `#ir-database-jan24`
- `#random` or `#water-cooler` - Simple chat with no topic.
- `#you-are-awesome` - A place to recognize team members.
- `#announcements` - Company-wide announcements.
- Automated channels: `#bot-github`, `#bot-salesforce`

## Scale-up

_50-300 people_

DevOps is evolving into a distinct entity as we progress, prompting us to
separate it from the Engineering channel. Similarly, we're detaching Design from
the Product channel. **The product will continue to focus on high-level matters
and important updates while the more tactical aspects shift to Design.**

Along this journey, we'll reach a point where introducing regional channels
becomes valuable. This necessity varies, as a company with 50 employees across
three cities may find it helpful, whereas one spread across 30+ cities might
not.

During this stage, we'll also need to refine departmental conversations,
enabling the introduction of team and guild channels. While guild and department
channels overlap, guild channels discuss the guild's activities. Therefore,
while product design and organization discussions occur in the department-design
channel, designers can connect with peers across teams and projects,
facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration.

As we move forward, the need for dedicated IT support arises, leading us to
create a dedicated channel. Integrating your knowledge base with Slack would be
highly beneficial if you still need to implement it.

- `#dept-dev-ops` - Split from engineering.
- `#it` - General IT support.
- `#dept-design` - Split from product.
- Regional channels - `#loc-atlanta`, `#geo-scranton`
- Team or pod channels - `#team-voltron`
- Guild channels - `#guild-design`

## Expansion

_♾️_

During the Expansion stage, the primary structural foundation has been laid, and
the emphasis now lies on extending operations and capabilities within the
established framework. **It marks a phase where the organization seeks to
maximize its potential and grow effectively.** This stage is characterized by a
concerted effort to harness the existing structure for expansion and
development.

## Bonus

Adding custom emojis and GIFs can be a game-changer for building a vibrant
company culture. They inject fun and personality into our conversations, making
work more enjoyable. Plus, they let us express ourselves uniquely, bringing the
team closer and showcasing our unique identity.

As we conclude this discussion, it's crucial to highlight a key point: while our
structured approach to organization may seem ambitious early on, it's a
strategic investment in our long-term success. **Questions about our
organizational structure and channel management aren't just recurring; they're
fundamental to our journey toward growth and excellence.** By establishing a
solid foundation now, we're not merely organizing for the present but laying the
groundwork for our future, enabling us to concentrate on what truly
matters—innovation, execution, and delivering value to our customers. Just like
a sturdy tree, our strength doesn't only come from visible branches but from
deep and robust roots. Let's nurture these roots, empowering ourselves to reach
new heights and unlock our full potential as senior leaders.
