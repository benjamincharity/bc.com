# BC.com Personal Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content-First Development
Every feature begins with content structure and user needs. Content delivery (MDX articles, data presentation) drives technical decisions. No feature exists solely for technical satisfaction - it must enhance content discoverability, readability, or user experience.

**Rationale**: As a personal website focused on articles and professional presence, the content and its effective delivery to readers is the primary value proposition.

### II. Progressive Enhancement
Start with core HTML/CSS functionality that works without JavaScript. Layer interactivity and advanced features progressively. Every feature must degrade gracefully when JavaScript fails or is disabled.

**Rationale**: Ensures maximum accessibility and resilience, respecting diverse user contexts and connection qualities.

### III. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Tests MUST be written before implementation. Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly:
1. Write failing tests that specify expected behavior
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

**Rationale**: Ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and documents expected behavior through test specifications.

### IV. Performance Budget
Every feature must meet performance targets:
- Initial page load: <3s on 3G connection
- Time to Interactive: <5s
- Lighthouse score: >90 for all metrics
- Build time: <60s for production builds

**Rationale**: User experience depends on fast, responsive interactions. Performance is a feature, not an afterthought.

### V. Simplicity Over Cleverness
Choose boring, proven solutions over novel approaches. Minimize dependencies and abstractions. Code should be readable by a junior developer without extensive documentation.

**Rationale**: Maintainability and longevity matter more than using cutting-edge patterns. Simple code has fewer bugs and is easier to modify.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier configured and enforced via pre-commit hooks
- No `any` types without explicit justification
- All public functions must have JSDoc comments
- Component props must be fully typed

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Integration tests for critical user paths
- E2E tests for article reading flow and core navigation
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new features
- Visual regression tests for component changes

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader testing for new features
- Color contrast ratios must pass automated checks
- Semantic HTML required

## Deployment & Operations

### Version Control
- Semantic versioning for all releases
- Conventional commits format required
- Feature branches with descriptive names
- Squash merges to main branch
- Protected main branch with required reviews

### Deployment Process
- All changes deploy through CI/CD pipeline
- Automated tests must pass before deployment
- Preview deployments for all PRs
- Production deployments only from main branch
- Rollback plan documented for major changes

### Monitoring & Observability
- Vercel Analytics for performance metrics
- Error tracking for JavaScript exceptions
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Build time and size tracking
- 404 monitoring for broken links

## Governance

### Amendment Process
1. Propose changes via PR with justification
2. Document impact on existing code and processes
3. Include migration plan if breaking changes
4. Require approval from repository owner
5. Update version following semantic versioning

### Compliance Verification
- All PRs must verify constitutional compliance in description
- Automated checks where possible (linting, tests, performance)
- Manual review checklist for subjective principles
- Quarterly review of principle effectiveness

### Exceptions & Deviations
- Must be documented in code comments with justification
- Temporary deviations require issue tracking for resolution
- Performance-critical paths may bypass some principles with explicit documentation
- Third-party integrations may require pragmatic compromises
