It seems we can track it back to the early 1990s at Apple. Coined by none other
than the influential author of _The Design of Everyday Things_ and _Emotional
Design_, [Donald Norman][dnorman].

According to his account:

> "I invented the term because I thought Human Interface and usability were too
> narrow: **I wanted to cover all aspects of the person's experience with a
> system,** including industrial design, graphics, the interface, the physical
> interaction, and the manual." <small>(Buley pg13)</small>
