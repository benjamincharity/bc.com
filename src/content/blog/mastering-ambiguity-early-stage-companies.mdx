## Exploring New Frontiers: iPad Infinite Canvas

In 2011, an Atlanta-based agency I was working with started a project with The
Home Depot to create a layout using an infinite canvas on the first-generation
iPad that had just been released. We aimed to revolutionize the way interactive
articles and how-to guides were presented. At that time, most experiences were
linear, magazine-like, requiring hefty download sizes that were too large for
mobile connections. Our objective was to introduce a dynamic and interactive
platform that would be user-friendly. During the early stages, the UX lead and I
worked closely together, engaging in an iterative process of exploration and
feedback that helped us push the limits of the iPad's capabilities. This journey
was not just about technical experimentation; we also integrated user insights
into the development process, making it a user-centered endeavor.

<small>_before it was cool_</small>

In 2017, I was appointed to lead a UX engineering team at a company. We
undertook an ambitious project to centralize our front-end ecosystem into a
monorepo. This was a year before the debut of NX or Lerna, two pivotal tools in
monorepo management. Our task was to consolidate front-end design systems, token
generation, data services, shared UI components, and company-wide linting and
testing configurations. During the first year, we focused on fine-tuning our
continuous integration (<abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr>) and
deployment (<abbr title="Continuous Deployment">CD</abbr>) processes while
building out the system's base. Since our team was relatively small, it was
crucial to streamline our workflows to avoid becoming a bottleneck in the
development process.
