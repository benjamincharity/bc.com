Ever wondered what the various <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
bracket styles were called? (neither did I but, it's actually pretty
interesting)

## _Default_

```css
.foo {
  color: red;
  display: block;
}
```

## _[Banner][banner]_

```css
.foo {
  color: red;
  display: block;
}
```

## _Saver_

```css
.foo {
  color: red;
  display: block;
}
```

## _Aligned_

```css
.foo {
  color: red;
  display: block;
}
```

## _[Pico][pico]_

```css
.foo {
  color: red;
  display: block;
}
```

## _Extra_

```css
.foo {
  color: red;
  display: block;
}
```

## _[GNU][gnu]_

```css
.foo {
  color: red;
  display: block;
}
```

## _HMANN_

```css
.foo {

  display: block;
}
```

Personally, I feel that the `default` style is by far the most readable,
followed closely by the `GNU` style. My primary issue with styles such as
`saver` or `pico` is that you cannot move entire lines up and down due to the
first and/or last declaration sharing a line with the selector or bracket.
