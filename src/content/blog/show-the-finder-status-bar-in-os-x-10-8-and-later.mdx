The Finder status bar offered a quick reference to how many files/folders
existed in the current directory along with your hard-drive's available space.

Finder, _without_ the status bar:

It turns out that rather than removing it, Apple simply defaulted it to hidden
(at least since 10.8).

With Finder focused, go to `View > Show Status Bar`. Or if you plan on toggling
the status bar on/off, simply hit <kbd>command+/</kbd> to quickly show or hide
the status bar.
