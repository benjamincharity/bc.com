# Implementation Plan: Update README and Prepare Cloudflare Deployment

**Branch**: `001-migrate-personal-blog` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-migrate-personal-blog/readme-cloudflare-spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-migrate-personal-blog/readme-cloudflare-spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Update the README documentation to reflect the new Astro stack implementation and prepare the CI/CD pipeline for deployment to Cloudflare Pages instead of Vercel. This involves documenting the Astro architecture, available commands, development setup, and configuring GitHub Actions for automated testing and Cloudflare deployment.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Node.js 20.x
**Primary Dependencies**: Astro 4.x, Tailwind CSS, MDX, Cloudflare Pages
**Storage**: Static site generation with MDX content files
**Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
**Target Platform**: Cloudflare Pages (static hosting)
**Project Type**: web - Static site with build-time generation
**Performance Goals**: <3s initial load on 3G, Lighthouse >90 all metrics
**Constraints**: Must maintain URL structure, zero downtime deployment
**Scale/Scope**: Personal blog site, ~50 articles, CI/CD pipeline

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principles Compliance
- [x] **Content-First Development**: Documentation update focuses on content delivery
- [x] **Progressive Enhancement**: README and deployment maintain core functionality
- [x] **Test-Driven Development**: GitHub Actions preserves test-first approach
- [x] **Performance Budget**: Cloudflare deployment targets <3s load times
- [x] **Simplicity Over Cleverness**: Using standard GitHub Actions and Cloudflare integration

### Development Standards
- [x] **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode maintained
- [x] **Testing Standards**: Preserving existing test suite in CI/CD
- [x] **Accessibility**: N/A for documentation and deployment config

### Deployment & Operations
- [x] **Version Control**: Following conventional commits
- [x] **Deployment Process**: CI/CD pipeline with automated tests
- [x] **Monitoring**: Cloudflare Analytics will replace Vercel Analytics

**Structure Decision**: Documentation-focused structure with GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD and standard Astro project layout. No backend services required as this is a static site.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Create minimal README task
- Create documentation directory structure tasks
- Populate individual documentation files
- CI workflow implementation from contract
- Cloudflare configuration tasks from quickstart
- Validation tasks from success criteria

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Documentation structure first: Create docs directory
- Documentation content second: Populate all docs files [P]
- Update minimal README third: Simple and clean
- CI setup fourth: Create GitHub Actions workflow
- Cloudflare configuration fifth: Connect and configure
- Validation last: Test entire pipeline
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where possible

**Estimated Output**: 18-22 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
1. Documentation structure creation (2-3 tasks)
2. Documentation file population (6 tasks, can be parallel)
3. Minimal README update (1 task)
4. CI workflow creation and testing (3-4 tasks)
5. Cloudflare setup and configuration (4-5 tasks)
6. Validation and cleanup (2-3 tasks)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
