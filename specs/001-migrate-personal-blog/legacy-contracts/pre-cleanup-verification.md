# Pre-Cleanup Verification Contract

**Contract**: Pre-Cleanup System Verification **Purpose**: Ensure Astro system
is fully functional before legacy file cleanup **Execution**: Required before
any file move operations

## Verification Requirements

### Build System Verification

```bash
# Contract: Build must complete successfully
pnpm build

# Expected Result: Exit code 0
# Expected Output: Build artifacts in dist/
# Expected Time: < 60 seconds
```

### Development Server Verification

```bash
# Contract: Dev server must start and serve content
pnpm dev

# Expected Result: Server running on configured port
# Expected Output: "Local: http://localhost:[port]"
# Expected Behavior: Homepage loads within 3 seconds
```

### Content Verification

```bash
# Contract: All content must be accessible
curl -s http://localhost:[port]/ | grep -q "expected-content"
curl -s http://localhost:[port]/articles | grep -q "article-list"

# Expected Result: Exit code 0 for each curl command
# Expected Content: Homepage and article list rendering
```

### Dependency Verification

```bash
# Contract: All dependencies must be available
pnpm list --depth=0

# Expected Result: No missing dependencies
# Expected Output: Clean dependency tree
# Expected Behavior: No peer dependency warnings
```

### TypeScript Verification

```bash
# Contract: TypeScript compilation must succeed
pnpm typecheck

# Expected Result: Exit code 0
# Expected Output: No type errors
# Expected Behavior: All files type-check successfully
```

### Linting Verification

```bash
# Contract: Code quality checks must pass
pnpm lint

# Expected Result: Exit code 0
# Expected Output: No lint errors
# Expected Behavior: Code style compliance verified
```

}
```

## Error Handling

### Build Failures

- **Action**: Stop cleanup process
- **Response**: Fix build errors before proceeding
- **Documentation**: Log specific error messages

### Dependency Issues

- **Action**: Resolve missing dependencies
- **Response**: Run `pnpm install` and re-verify
- **Documentation**: Update package.json if needed

### TypeScript Errors

- **Action**: Fix type issues
- **Response**: Resolve all TypeScript compilation errors
- **Documentation**: Ensure strict mode compliance

### Performance Issues

- **Action**: Investigate performance bottlenecks
- **Response**: Optimize before cleanup
- **Documentation**: Baseline performance metrics

## Implementation Notes

- Run verification in clean environment
- Document all check results
- Save verification output for reference
- Proceed only on complete success
- Create checkpoint for rollback if needed
