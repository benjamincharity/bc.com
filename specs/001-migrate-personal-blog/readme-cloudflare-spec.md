# Feature Specification: Update README and Prepare Cloudflare Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `001-migrate-personal-blog` **Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft **Input**: User description: "I need to update my readme for
this new stack. It should be based off my legacy readme. Also we should get
prepped for my new deploy path. in the past, we deployed by using GitHub actions
for the CI process and anytime we pushed to Main vercel would deploy. going
forward we will still use GitHub actions for testing and making sure the build
works, etc. but we will be deploying to cloud flare instead"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: README update for Astro stack, Cloudflare deployment preparation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: documentation update, CI/CD pipeline, deployment platform change
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Cloudflare Pages configuration specifics marked for clarification
   ‚Üí Build output directory for Cloudflare marked
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer needs updated docs for new stack
   ‚Üí CI/CD pipeline needs Cloudflare deployment
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
   ‚Üí Marked deployment specifics needing clarification
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí README documentation, GitHub Actions workflows, deployment config
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties around Cloudflare config"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for
   any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login
   system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable
   and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on benjamincharity.com, I need updated documentation that
reflects the new Astro stack and clear deployment instructions for Cloudflare
Pages, so I can understand the project setup and confidently deploy changes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer clones the repository, **When** they read the README,
   **Then** they understand the Astro stack setup, available commands, and
   project structure
2. **Given** a developer pushes to main branch, **When** GitHub Actions runs,
   **Then** tests execute and the site deploys to Cloudflare Pages
3. **Given** a developer needs to run the project locally, **When** they follow
   README instructions, **Then** they can successfully start the development
   server
4. **Given** a deployment fails, **When** checking GitHub Actions, **Then**
   clear feedback indicates whether tests or deployment failed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Cloudflare deployment fails but tests pass?
- How does system handle environment variable differences between Vercel and
  Cloudflare?
- What happens during the transition period between Vercel and Cloudflare?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: README MUST document the Astro stack architecture and project
  structure
- **FR-002**: README MUST list all available development and build commands
- **FR-003**: README MUST include setup instructions for local development
- **FR-004**: GitHub Actions MUST run tests on every push to main branch
- **FR-005**: GitHub Actions MUST trigger Cloudflare Pages deployment after
  successful tests
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve existing GitHub Actions CI testing
  functionality
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST specify required environment variables for
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which environment variables are needed for Cloudflare vs
  Vercel?]
- **FR-008**: README MUST include deployment badge for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION:
  Cloudflare status badge format/availability?]
- **FR-009**: GitHub Actions workflow MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION:
  Cloudflare Pages deployment method - Direct API, Wrangler CLI, or GitHub
  integration?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST configure build output for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Astro
  static output directory for Cloudflare - dist/ or public/?]

### Key Entities

- **README.md**: Primary documentation file describing project setup, commands,
  and deployment
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: CI/CD pipeline configuration that runs tests and
  triggers deployments
- **Cloudflare Pages Config**: Deployment settings specifying build commands and
  output directory
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration values needed for different
  deployment environments
