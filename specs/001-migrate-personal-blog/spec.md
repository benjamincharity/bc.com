## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Migration from Remix to Astro framework
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: end-users (blog visitors)
   ‚Üí Actions: reading articles, toggling themes, interacting with UI elements
   ‚Üí Data: MDX articles, user preferences, newsletter subscriptions
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain URL structure, preserve all functionality, improve load performance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects specified in description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows for blog interaction
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and preserves existing features
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Articles, User Preferences, Newsletter Subscriptions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed - fully specified migration
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a blog visitor, I want to access and read articles with optimal loading speed and minimal time to first content paint, while maintaining all interactive features that enhance my reading experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor accesses the blog home page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the initial content should be visible within 1 second on a 4G connection
2. **Given** a visitor navigates to an article page, **When** the article loads, **Then** the content should be readable immediately with progressive enhancement for interactive features
3. **Given** a visitor changes the theme preference, **When** the page reloads, **Then** the selected theme should persist without flash of unstyled content (FOUC)
4. **Given** a visitor interacts with the canvas background, **When** they click or touch the canvas, **Then** the interactive animations should respond without blocking main content
5. **Given** a visitor subscribes to the newsletter, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they should receive real-time validation feedback and confirmation
6. **Given** a visitor accesses the site offline after initial visit, **When** they navigate to cached pages, **Then** the content should be available from service worker cache
7. **Given** a visitor with reduced motion preference, **When** they navigate the site, **Then** all animations should respect their preference settings

### Edge Cases
- What happens when JavaScript is disabled? Core content must remain accessible
- How does system handle slow network connections? Progressive loading with content prioritization
- What happens when service worker update is available? Seamless update without interrupting user experience
- How does system handle browser back/forward navigation? Maintain scroll position and state

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST preserve all existing article content in MDX format with current metadata structure
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain current URL structure for all pages and articles to preserve SEO and external links
- **FR-003**: System MUST improve initial page load speed compared to current Remix implementation
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to toggle between dark and light themes with instant switching and persistence
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide interactive canvas background with mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to subscribe to newsletter with real-time form validation
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to switch between grid and compact article view layouts
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement progressive web app functionality with offline support
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve all current content transformations (syntax highlighting, auto-linking headings, GitHub Flavored Markdown)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide smooth scroll behaviors and header animations
- **FR-011**: System MUST display console Easter egg on initial page load
- **FR-012**: System MUST track and restore navigation history for enhanced user experience
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate and cache article metadata at build time for optimal performance
- **FR-014**: System MUST respect user's reduced motion preferences across all animations
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain continuous integration and deployment workflow

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Article**: Blog post content with title, date, tags, description, reading time, and MDX body content
- **User Preference**: Theme selection (dark/light/system), view mode (grid/compact), and animation settings
- **Newsletter Subscription**: Email address and subscription status for newsletter service
- **Navigation State**: Browser history tracking and scroll position restoration
- **Cache State**: Service worker cache for assets, data, and documents for offline support
