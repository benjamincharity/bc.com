# Tasks: Update README and Prepare Cloudflare Deployment

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-migrate-personal-blog/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/ ✓, quickstart.md ✓

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: TypeScript 5.x, Astro 4.x, Cloudflare Pages
2. Load design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: Documentation entities → documentation tasks
   → contracts/: CI workflow, Cloudflare config, README structure
   → quickstart.md: Validation scenarios → test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: documentation structure, CI workflow
   → Tests: validation tests for configs and docs
   → Core: documentation files, workflow implementation
   → Integration: Cloudflare connection, deployment
   → Polish: validation, cleanup, testing
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Documentation before configuration
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. SUCCESS: tasks ready for execution
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 3.1: Setup and Structure

- [ ] **T001** Create documentation directory structure at `/docs/`
- [ ] **T002** [P] Create empty documentation files: docs/README.md, docs/development.md, docs/deployment.md, docs/architecture.md, docs/testing.md, docs/contributing.md
- [ ] **T003** [P] Create GitHub Actions workflow directory at `/.github/workflows/`

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These validation tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY content implementation**

- [ ] **T004** [P] Create README validation test in `/tests/docs/test-readme-structure.js` - verify minimal structure, quick start commands, badge presence
- [ ] **T005** [P] Create CI workflow validation test in `/tests/workflows/test-ci-syntax.js` - verify YAML syntax, required steps, Node 20
- [ ] **T006** [P] Create documentation links test in `/tests/docs/test-internal-links.js` - verify all internal links resolve correctly
- [ ] **T007** [P] Create command validation test in `/tests/docs/test-documented-commands.js` - verify all documented commands actually work

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

### Documentation Content
- [ ] **T008** [P] Write docs/README.md - documentation index with navigation links
- [ ] **T009** [P] Write docs/development.md - prerequisites, setup, commands, project structure
- [ ] **T010** [P] Write docs/deployment.md - Cloudflare Pages setup, environment variables, preview deployments
- [ ] **T011** [P] Write docs/architecture.md - tech stack, key features, performance targets
- [ ] **T012** [P] Write docs/testing.md - unit tests, E2E tests, CI pipeline
- [ ] **T013** [P] Write docs/contributing.md - process, commit conventions

### Configuration Files
- [ ] **T014** Create CI workflow file at `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` based on contract specification
- [ ] **T015** Update minimal README.md - title, badge, description, hero image, quick start, docs link

## Phase 3.4: Integration and Configuration

- [ ] **T016** Configure Cloudflare Pages project via dashboard - connect GitHub repo, set build settings
- [ ] **T017** Test CI workflow execution - push branch, verify all steps run successfully
- [ ] **T018** Update deployment badge URL in README.md once Cloudflare project is live
- [ ] **T019** Remove legacy Vercel configuration files - vercel.json, .vercelignore

## Phase 3.5: Validation and Polish

- [ ] **T020** [P] Run README validation test - verify structure matches contract
- [ ] **T021** [P] Run CI workflow validation test - verify syntax and required steps
- [ ] **T022** [P] Run documentation links test - verify all internal links work
- [ ] **T023** [P] Run command validation test - verify all documented commands execute successfully
- [ ] **T024** Test complete deployment pipeline - push to main, verify Cloudflare deployment
- [ ] **T025** Manual validation per quickstart guide - follow all steps to verify functionality
- [ ] **T026** [P] Run markdown linting on all documentation files
- [ ] **T027** Clean up any placeholder content or temporary files

## Dependencies

**Critical Path:**
- Structure (T001-T003) → Tests (T004-T007) → Content (T008-T015) → Integration (T016-T019) → Validation (T020-T027)

**Parallel Opportunities:**
- T002: All doc files can be created simultaneously
- T004-T007: All validation tests can be written in parallel
- T008-T013: All documentation content can be written in parallel
- T020-T023, T026: All validation tasks can run in parallel

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Create All Documentation Structure
```bash
# Can run these simultaneously
Task T002: Create docs/README.md
Task T002: Create docs/development.md
Task T002: Create docs/deployment.md
Task T002: Create docs/architecture.md
Task T002: Create docs/testing.md
Task T002: Create docs/contributing.md
```

### Write All Validation Tests
```bash
# These can be developed in parallel
Task T004: tests/docs/test-readme-structure.js
Task T005: tests/workflows/test-ci-syntax.js
Task T006: tests/docs/test-internal-links.js
Task T007: tests/docs/test-documented-commands.js
```

### Write All Documentation Content
```bash
# Content can be written simultaneously by different team members
Task T008: docs/README.md
Task T009: docs/development.md
Task T010: docs/deployment.md
Task T011: docs/architecture.md
Task T012: docs/testing.md
Task T013: docs/contributing.md
```

### Run Final Validation
```bash
# All validation can run concurrently
Task T020: README validation
Task T021: CI workflow validation
Task T022: Links validation
Task T023: Commands validation
Task T026: Markdown linting
```

## Success Criteria

All tasks complete when:
- [ ] Minimal README with quick start working
- [ ] Complete docs/ directory with all guides
- [ ] CI workflow running successfully on all pushes
- [ ] Cloudflare Pages auto-deploying from main branch
- [ ] All validation tests passing
- [ ] All documentation links working
- [ ] All documented commands execute successfully
