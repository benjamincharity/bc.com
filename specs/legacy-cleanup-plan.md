# Feature Specification: Legacy Remix Code Cleanup

**Feature Branch**: `001-migrate-personal-blog`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We recently converted my personal website and blog from remix to Astro. Both apps still are currently living in this repo. see @specs/001-migrate-personal-blog/spec.md This is causing a lot of issues and needs to be cleaned up. Can you help me create a safe plan to move all legacy code related to remix and vercel Into a temporary directory named appropriately. Until we are positive that the new site is working perfectly. We need to keep the legacy code accessible for reference. But we need to be easily cleaned up once that is done so having it all in one sub directory would be ideal. But we need to make sure that it is only the legacy code and we don't break anything from our new Astro"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Legacy Remix/Vercel code cleanup after Astro migration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers maintaining the site
   ‚Üí Actions: moving legacy files, preserving access, cleanup preparation
   ‚Üí Data: legacy Remix app files, Vercel config, build artifacts
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain Astro functionality, keep legacy accessible, enable easy cleanup
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects specified in description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear developer workflows for legacy management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement preserves new Astro functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Legacy Files, Astro Files, Configuration Files
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed - fully specified cleanup
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific file operations, directory structures)
- üë• Written for project stakeholders managing the migration

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the migrated Astro site, I want all legacy Remix and Vercel code organized in a temporary directory so that I can reference it when needed while keeping the main codebase clean and ensuring the new Astro implementation remains fully functional.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the legacy Remix code is moved to a temporary directory, **When** I build and test the Astro site, **Then** all functionality should work identically to before the cleanup
2. **Given** I need to reference legacy implementation details, **When** I navigate to the temporary directory, **Then** I should find all original Remix files with their structure preserved
3. **Given** the Astro site is confirmed working perfectly, **When** I decide to remove legacy code, **Then** I should be able to delete the entire temporary directory safely
4. **Given** I'm developing new features in Astro, **When** I work in the main codebase, **Then** I should not encounter conflicts or confusion from legacy files
5. **Given** the cleanup is complete, **When** new team members join the project, **Then** they should only see the current Astro implementation without legacy distractions

### Edge Cases
- What happens if legacy files are accidentally needed for Astro functionality? All current Astro files must remain untouched
- How does the system handle shared configuration files? Preserve any configs that Astro depends on
- What happens if the temporary directory grows too large? Directory should be easily identifiable for cleanup
- How does the system handle hidden files and build artifacts? All legacy-related files must be moved consistently

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST preserve all current Astro functionality after legacy code is moved to temporary directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST move all Remix-specific files and dependencies to a clearly named temporary directory
- **FR-003**: System MUST move all Vercel-specific configuration and deployment files to the temporary directory
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve the original structure of legacy files within the temporary directory for reference
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure no Astro files or configurations are affected by the legacy cleanup process
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow for complete removal of the temporary directory without affecting Astro functionality
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain clear separation between active Astro code and archived legacy code
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve any shared assets or content that both systems might reference
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure build processes for Astro continue to work without modification
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain version control history for moved files through proper git operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Legacy Remix Files**: All app/, routes/, components/, and utility files specific to the old Remix implementation
- **Vercel Configuration**: Deployment configs, build settings, and platform-specific files for the previous hosting setup
- **Astro Files**: Current implementation files that must remain untouched and functional
- **Shared Resources**: Assets, content, or configurations that might be referenced by both systems
- **Temporary Archive**: Organized directory structure containing all legacy code for reference and eventual cleanup
