This directory contains the complete Remix implementation that was replaced by Astro.

## Directory Structure

- `app/` - Complete Remix application (routes, components, utils, styles)
- `config/` - Remix build and server configuration files
  - `remix.config.js` - Remix build configuration
  - `remix.env.d.ts` - TypeScript environment definitions
  - `server.js` - Server entry point
- `deployment/` - Vercel deployment configuration (no longer used)
  - `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment settings
  - `.node-version` - Node.js version specification
- `testing/` - Test framework configuration files
  - `jest.config.ts` - Jest test configuration
  - `babel.config.js` - Babel transformation configuration
- `package-backup.json` - Original package.json before dependency cleanup

## Purpose

These files are archived for reference during the Astro migration period.
They can be safely deleted once the Astro implementation is proven stable.

## Migration Date

## Removal

This entire directory can be safely removed once confident in the Astro implementation:
```bash
rm -rf legacy-remix/
```

## Notes

- The new Astro site is now the primary implementation
- Build commands have been updated to use Astro CLI
- Deployment target changed from Vercel to Cloudflare Pages
