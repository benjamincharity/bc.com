# FAQ Schema Guidelines for Articles

This document provides guidance on creating FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) structured data for blog articles to improve SEO and enable Google FAQ rich results.

## What is FAQ Structured Data?

FAQ structured data is a way to mark up question-and-answer content on your pages so Google can display them as rich results in search. When properly implemented, your article can appear with expandable questions directly in search results, increasing visibility and click-through rates.

### Benefits

- **Increased SERP Real Estate**: Your listing takes up more space in search results
- **Higher CTR**: FAQ snippets are eye-catching and drive more clicks
- **Answer Questions Directly**: Users can see answers without clicking
- **Voice Search Optimization**: Great for "how to" and "what is" voice queries
- **Build Authority**: Demonstrates expertise on the topic

### When to Use FAQ Schema

Add FAQ schema to articles that naturally answer common questions, including:

- **Guides & How-Tos**: Implementation guides, tutorials, step-by-step processes
- **Post-Mortems**: Incident analysis, retrospectives, learning resources
- **Career Advice**: Transition guides, advancement strategies
- **Product/Startup Content**: Best practices, tool comparisons, strategic decisions
- **Technical Articles**: Performance optimization, architecture decisions

## Writing Effective FAQs

### Question Guidelines

1. **Use Natural Language**: Write questions as users would actually search
   - ✅ "How do I implement psychological safety in my team?"
   - ❌ "Psychological safety implementation methodology"

2. **Be Specific**: Questions should be clear and focused
   - ✅ "What are the three walls engineering teams hit while scaling?"
   - ❌ "What are scaling challenges?"

3. **Include Keywords**: Use your article's primary keywords naturally
   - If your article is about "post-mortem processes", use "post-mortem" in questions

4. **Common Search Intent**: Address what readers typically search for
   - "What is...", "How do I...", "Why does...", "When should..."

### Answer Guidelines

1. **Length**: 2-4 sentences, 40-300 words
   - Too short: Lacks depth and value
   - Too long: Loses reader attention

2. **Complete But Concise**: Answer the question fully without requiring article reading
   - Google may show the answer directly in search results
   - Don't just tease - provide real value

3. **Use Data When Possible**: Include statistics, percentages, specific numbers
   - ✅ "Organizations see up to 50% fewer repeat incidents"
   - ❌ "Organizations see fewer incidents"

4. **Avoid Self-Reference**: Don't say "in this article" or "read more below"
   - The answer should stand alone

5. **Natural Keyword Usage**: Include relevant keywords without stuffing

### Optimal Number of Questions

- **Minimum**: 3 questions per article
- **Maximum**: 8 questions per article
- **Sweet Spot**: 4-6 questions for most articles

Too few questions won't provide enough value. Too many can dilute focus and make it harder for Google to extract key information.

## Adding FAQs to Your Articles

### 1. Identify the Article

Determine if your article warrants FAQs. Good candidates:
- Answer specific, searchable questions
- Cover topics with common queries
- Provide actionable guidance
- Explain complex concepts

### 2. Extract Questions

Read through your article and identify:
- Main concepts explained
- Problems solved
- Actionable advice given
- Common misconceptions addressed

### 3. Add to faq-schema.ts

Open `src/utils/faq-schema.ts` and add your FAQ content:

```typescript
export const FAQ_CONTENT: Record<string, FAQItem[]> = {
  // ... existing content ...

  'your-article-slug': [
    {
      question: 'Your first question?',
      answer: 'A complete answer in 2-4 sentences providing real value and including relevant keywords naturally.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Your second question?',
      answer: 'Another complete answer that stands alone and provides actionable information.',
    },
    // Add 3-8 total questions
  ],
};
```

### 4. Verify Build

Run the build to ensure no errors:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Test in Production

After deployment, test with:
- [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/)

## Examples

### Example 1: Technical Guide

**Article**: "Performance Budgets Guide"

```typescript
'performance-budgets-guide': [
  {
    question: 'What is a performance budget and why do I need one?',
    answer: 'A performance budget is a set of limits for key metrics that affect web performance, similar to a financial budget. It provides a shared language for all stakeholders, enables data-driven decision-making, helps maintain gains and avoid regressions, and supports holistic decision-making between features and performance.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the key metrics to track in a performance budget?',
    answer: 'Core metrics include LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) for when users see main content, CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) for layout stability, TTFB (Time to First Byte) for backend response times, and TBT (Total Blocking Time) for interactivity delays.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are industry standard performance budgets for mobile apps?',
    answer: 'For mobile apps, aim for TTI under 5 seconds on a 3G network, JavaScript payload under 170KB, FID under 100ms for responsiveness, and LCP under 2.5 seconds. These benchmarks ensure good performance even on slower devices and networks.',
  },
];
```

### Example 2: Leadership Article

**Article**: "Leadership Transition Engineers to Director"

```typescript
'leadership-transition-engineers-director': [
  {
    question: 'What is the hardest transition in an engineering career?',
    answer: "The toughest leap isn't learning a new language or scaling a system—it's stepping into leadership for the first time. Engineers often underestimate how different the job becomes once you stop being judged on your commits.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do engineers fail when transitioning to director?',
    answer: "Engineers fail when they either keep trying to lead by being the super-engineer or overcompensate by leaning too hard into process. Both approaches fail because leadership is about enabling others, not scaling your personal output.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How should I redefine success as an engineering director?',
    answer: "Your value is no longer in writing code—it's in creating the environment where others do their best work. Your credibility grows when you protect your team's bandwidth, provide clarity, and conduct fair evaluations.",
  },
];
```

## Workflow for New Articles

When creating a new article, follow this checklist:

- [ ] Write and publish your article
- [ ] Identify 4-6 key questions the article answers
- [ ] Draft FAQ items (questions + answers)
- [ ] Review answers for completeness (can they stand alone?)
- [ ] Add to `src/utils/faq-schema.ts`
- [ ] Build and test locally
- [ ] Deploy and verify with Google Rich Results Test

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't

1. **Use vague questions**: "What should I know about X?" → Be specific
2. **Write incomplete answers**: Avoid teasing "Read the article to find out!"
3. **Stuff keywords**: Natural usage only
4. **Duplicate content**: Each answer should be unique
5. **Ignore structure**: Organize FAQs by category in the file
6. **Skip validation**: Always test after deployment

### ✅ Do

1. **Be specific and actionable**: Ask questions users would actually search
2. **Provide complete answers**: Standalone value in each FAQ
3. **Use natural language**: Write for humans first, search engines second
4. **Organize logically**: Group related FAQs in the file with comments
5. **Update regularly**: Add FAQs to new articles consistently
6. **Test thoroughly**: Verify rich results appear correctly

## SEO Impact

Articles with well-implemented FAQ schema typically see:

- **20-30% CTR increase** from FAQ rich results
- **Better rankings** for question-based queries
- **Increased visibility** in voice search results
- **More featured snippets** opportunities

## Monitoring & Iteration

### Track Performance

Monitor in Google Search Console:
- Search appearance > Rich results
- Performance by query (look for question queries)
- Click-through rates for pages with FAQs

### Iterate Based on Data

- If a question gets lots of impressions but low clicks, improve the answer
- If certain FAQs appear in rich results, create similar ones for other articles
- Update FAQs as article content evolves
