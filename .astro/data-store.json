Here is how b...","ai-replacing-juniors.webp",false,7,"## The Silent Shift in Workforce Development\n\nAI is creeping into workplaces faster than a double espresso kicks in on a\nMonday morning. From coding and marketing to finance and legal research,\ncompanies are integrating AI at lightning speed—particularly in junior roles.\n\n![Futuristic office split: AI-powered robots on left, humans on right.](ai-replacing-juniors.webp)\n\nOn the surface, this makes sense. AI is efficient, cost-effective, and doesn’t\ntake coffee breaks. But there’s one major question that businesses aren’t\nasking:\n\n**What happens when we remove the entry points into an industry?**\n\nSenior professionals don’t just magically appear. Their expertise is forged over\nyears of hands-on work, trial and error, and learning from real-world\nchallenges. If AI replaces junior roles entirely, we risk cutting off the very\nfoundation that produces mid-level and senior experts.\n\nLet’s break down what’s happening, why it’s a problem, and how we can ensure AI\nenhances workforce development rather than dismantling it.\n\n## AI’s Takeover of Junior Roles: The Great Restructuring\n\nAI thrives on repetitive, structured tasks, making it an appealing alternative\nfor companies eager to streamline operations. Here’s what that looks like across\ndifferent industries:\n\n- **Software development** → AI-powered coding assistants generate boilerplate\n  code, write documentation, and even debug errors.\n- **Marketing** → AI crafts blog posts, manages ad campaigns, and analyzes\n  performance data.\n- **Finance & legal research** → AI processes massive datasets and generates\n  reports in seconds—tasks that once took junior analysts days.\n\nAs a result, companies are shifting their hiring focus. Instead of bringing in\njuniors to handle these tasks, they expect mid-level and senior professionals to\noversee AI-driven workflows.\n\nSounds efficient, right? The problem is, **this assumes that juniors are no\nlonger necessary because AI allows professionals to start at a higher level.**\nAnd that’s where things get messy.\n\n## The Flawed Assumption: AI-Equipped Juniors Are Not Mid-Level Professionals\n\nSome argue that AI will help juniors 'skip ahead,' performing certain mid-level\ntasks without following the traditional learning curve. While AI can assist with\nexecution, it doesn’t replace the hands-on learning that develops real\nexpertise.\n\n- **Expertise isn’t just about completing tasks—it’s about understanding _why_\n  things work the way they do.**\n- Real-world problem-solving means navigating constraints, debugging unexpected\n  failures, and understanding business logic—not just following AI-generated\n  solutions.\n- AI can assist in execution, but it doesn’t replace **the development of\n  judgment**, which is crucial for mid-level and senior professionals.\n\nWithout foundational learning, AI-assisted professionals may appear competent\nbut lack the depth needed to make informed decisions, troubleshoot effectively,\nand drive innovation.\n\n### Why This Matters: The Flight Simulator Problem\n\nAI is like a flight simulator—it can teach you the mechanics of flying, show you\nhow to take off and land, and even simulate turbulence.\n\nBut if you’ve never actually flown a real plane, you won’t have the instincts\ndeveloped from hands-on experience.\n\n- You won’t know how to feel the plane’s response in real time.\n- You won’t have the muscle memory to react instinctively to sudden changes.\n- You won’t be prepared for unpredictable real-world scenarios that the\n  simulator didn’t cover.\n\nSimilarly, AI can assist with tasks, but it doesn’t replace the deep\nunderstanding that comes from years of hands-on work.\n\nJuniors who rely on AI too soon might look competent on the surface, but when\nfaced with an unexpected challenge—or a situation that AI doesn’t have a\npre-written answer for—they’ll struggle. That’s because they haven’t built the\nreal-world experience that mid-level and senior professionals rely on to make\ninformed decisions.\n\nJust like pilots need actual flight hours to become skilled, professionals need\nreal-world experience—not just AI-assisted shortcuts—to develop true expertise.\n\n## The Hidden Cost: Killing Junior Roles Disrupts the Talent Pipeline\n\nFor decades, these roles have served as the starting point for future industry\nleaders. Employees traditionally begin with foundational tasks, gain hands-on\nexperience, and gradually take on more responsibility. However, when companies\nremove junior positions, they also eliminate this natural path for career\nprogression.\n\nEliminating junior roles may offer some short-term benefits. Companies can\nreduce hiring costs, improve efficiency, and leverage AI-driven productivity to\nstreamline operations. However, these immediate gains come with significant\nlong-term consequences.\n\nOver time, organizations will face a shortage of experienced professionals,\nmaking it harder to fill mid-level and senior positions. This scarcity will\ndrive up hiring costs for more advanced roles and increase reliance on external\nhires who lack institutional knowledge.\n\nThis creates a paradox: **Companies still need mid-level and senior experts, but\nthey’re cutting off the roles that produce them.**\n\n## The Future Consequences of an AI-First Workforce Without Juniors\n\nWhat does a world without junior employees look like? Here’s what businesses\nrisk in the long run:\n\n### 1. An Expertise Bottleneck\n\n- Today’s entry-level roles are tomorrow’s leadership pipeline. Fewer juniors\n  today mean fewer experts tomorrow.\n- Industries could face a talent crisis where demand for skilled professionals\n  exceeds supply.\n\n### 2. Over-Reliance on External Hiring\n\n- Companies will struggle to promote from within due to a lack of institutional\n  knowledge.\n- External hires are costly, harder to integrate, and may not fully understand a\n  company’s unique challenges.\n\n### 3. Loss of Innovation and Critical Thinking\n\n- Junior employees often bring fresh perspectives and challenge outdated\n  assumptions.\n- AI can optimize existing processes but won’t replace the human intuition and\n  creativity that drive real innovation.\n\n### 4. A “Shallow Knowledge” Workforce\n\n- Employees relying on AI from day one may develop a **surface-level**\n  understanding of their field.\n- They’ll perform well under normal conditions but struggle when faced with\n  **edge cases** that require deeper expertise.\n\nIt’s the difference between knowing _how_ to drive and knowing _how a car\nworks_—one lets you get from A to B, while the other helps when things break\ndown.\n\n## The Path Forward: AI as an Accelerator, Not a Replacement\n\nThe goal isn’t to resist AI—it’s to use it wisely. AI should be positioned as a\n**tool for acceleration, not a replacement for learning.**\n\n### How AI Can Enhance Junior Learning Instead of Eliminating It:\n\n- **AI as a tutor** → Providing real-time feedback and guidance for entry-level\n  employees.\n- **AI-assisted troubleshooting** → Helping juniors solve problems but still\n  requiring human decision-making.\n- **Automation of low-value tasks** → Freeing up time for juniors to focus on\n  strategic learning opportunities.\n\n**Rather than scrapping junior roles, companies should redesign them** to\nincorporate AI while preserving the necessary learning curve.\n\n### A Hybrid Approach: AI + Mentorship = Sustainable Growth\n\n- **Structured mentorship** → Combining AI-driven efficiencies with hands-on\n  training ensures junior employees receive both guidance and real-world\n  experience.\n- **Apprenticeship-style learning** → Allowing juniors to work alongside\n  experienced professionals helps them develop industry-specific skills.\n- **AI-enhanced learning environments** → Supporting critical thinking and\n  problem-solving ensures that juniors grow beyond automation and remain\n  valuable contributors.\n\n**The industries that get this right will future-proof their workforce. Those\nthat don’t? They’ll be scrambling for talent when AI alone isn’t enough.**\n\n## Conclusion: Rethinking the AI-Driven Workforce Strategy\n\nThe rush to replace juniors with AI overlooks the bigger picture.\n\n- **Expertise takes time**—AI can’t replace the hands-on experience that builds\n  great professionals.\n- **Companies need to balance efficiency with long-term workforce development.**\n- **AI should be used to accelerate skill-building, not cut off the learning\n  process entirely.**\n\nThe real question isn’t _\"How do we replace junior employees?\"_ but rather:\n**\"How do we use AI to make the next generation of professionals even better?\"**\n\nForward-thinking businesses will see AI not as a shortcut to efficiency, but as\na tool to enhance human potential. The future of expertise depends on it.","src/content/blog/ai-replacing-junior-roles-future-of-expertise.mdx","a1b238d00d6c12a3",true,"angular-gatsby-to-remix-transition",{"id":28,"data":30,"body":43,"filePath":44,"digest":45,"deferredRender":27},{"title":31,"date":32,"tags":33,"description":40,"image":41,"draft":22,"readingTime":42},"Transitioning from Angular 12 and GatsbyJS to Remix",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.219Z"],[34,35,36,37,38,39],"angular","javascript","remix","vite","tailwind","vercel","I share my experience transitioning a web project from Angular 12 and GatsbyJS to Remix, using Vite and PNPM, and moving from Netlify to Vercel. Discover les...","snail-and-leopard.webp",9,"In addition to the technical details of the transition, I also want to share\nsome of the challenges and benefits of using Remix. With Remix, I found it\neasier to manage my content and present it in a more organized and visually\nappealing way. The platform also allowed me to integrate various tools and\nservices that improve user experience and streamline development. One of the\nmost exciting features of Remix is its support for server-side rendering, which\nsignificantly enhances the website's performance and SEO.\n\n![A 16x9 neo-brutalist image showcasing a scale with a snail on one side and a leopard in a snail shell on the other. Predominantly black and white, with pops of color highlighting key elements. The background features abstract geometric shapes, enhancing the minimalist, modern design.](snail-and-leopard.webp)\n\nWith all these advantages, my website is now better positioned to serve its\nintended audience. So, without further ado, let's dive into the details of how I\nmade the switch and what I learned along the way.\n\n## Choosing Remix for SSR and BFF Solutions\n\nWhile deciding which framework to use for my website, I found server-side\nrendering (SSR) a crucial feature. It significantly improves website load times\nand overall performance, especially for content-heavy websites. After thorough\nresearch, I found that Remix's inherent SSR design makes it the perfect choice\nfor my needs.\n\nI have found the need for a dedicated backend for the front end (BFF) in\nmultiple projects. What drew me towards Remix was its capability to simplify the\ncreation of specific client APIs and optimize other front-end elements. With its\nability to handle server-side rendering (SSR) and provide a flexible BFF\nframework, I realized that Remix was a choice and a strategic solution for my\nwebsite.\n\n## The Shift to Vite\n\nAs a web developer, I fully comprehend performance's crucial role in achieving\nsuccess while building tools. That's why I was impressed with Vite. Its\nreputation for being fast was not just empty talk; I experienced it, and it was\ngenuinely unique.\n\nOver the years, I have used various build tools, but using Vite felt like a\nbreath of fresh air. Its speed was not just noticeable - it was\ntransformational. **Processes like compiling and bundling, which once took\nsignificant time, were now happening almost instantly.** This improved\nefficiency fundamentally changed my workflow, making the development process\nmore fluid.\n\nWhat I loved most about Vite was how easily it integrated with my workflow and\nhow much it improved my productivity. The difference in speed was glaring, and\ngoing back to slower tools felt like a step backward. Vite proved to be a\ngame-changer for my project in a world where development cycles are constantly\nunder pressure to be shorter.\n\n## Transitioning to PNPM from NPM and Yarn\n\n![Isometric graphic of a software development lifecycle with package managers, version control, and programming tools ascending along a growth arrow in yellow and blue tones.](angular-to-remix-2_agoerm.webp)\n\nI have switched from using NPM to Yarn and now to PNPM. This change was not just\nout of curiosity but was driven by recognizing the capabilities of PNPM.\n\nWhat initially impressed me about PNPM was its speed, which has been a recurring\ntheme in my recent tech stack updates. **I found PNPM's efficiency almost\nstartling,** much like my experience with Vite. Package installation and\nmanagement, which used to be a routine chore, suddenly became faster and more\nstreamlined.\n\nIn my career, I have used NPM in the first half and Yarn in the second half,\nwitnessing the evolution of package management in the JavaScript ecosystem. PNPM\nstood out not only because of its speed but also because of its familiar command\nstructure. This familiarity made the transition feel less like learning a new\ntool and more like upgrading to a better version of an old one.\n\nBut it wasn't just about comfort; it was about performance. In the fast-paced\nworld of web development, every second saved in package management translates to\nmore time focusing on actual development. Therefore, PNPM has become an integral\npart of my tech stack.\n\n## Exploring SSR for the First Time with RemixJS\n\nI used to have a static website but wanted to try server-side rendering (SSR)\nwith a single-page application (SPA). After learning about RemixJS and its\nrobustness in a React-based ecosystem, I decided to use it.\n\nInitially, I hesitated about SSR, but RemixJS helped me appreciate its benefits.\nThe framework's implementation of SSR was particularly impressive in terms of\nperformance and user experience, especially for sites with rich content.\n\nChoosing RemixJS for my first deep dive into SSR wasn't just about trying a new\ntechnology. It represented a significant step in my development practice, where\nI embraced a more integrated approach, balancing server-side efficiency with a\ndynamic front-end experience.\n\nIn my previous roles, I gained expertise in managing performance and designing\nattractive user interfaces in a Single Page Application (SPA) environment. This\nexperience made me confident in handling data dynamically and efficiently.\nHowever, I faced a new challenge when I switched to using Server-Side Rendering\n(SSR) with RemixJS. It required a change in mindset, especially regarding how\ninitial data is handled.\n\nWith SSR, the approach to data delivery is fundamentally different. Loading\ninitial data is not only a matter of client-side requests but also involves a\nserver-side process that was new territory for me. This shift was not just a\ntechnical transition but a conceptual one, requiring me to rethink the\nstrategies I had previously accustomed to in a SPA context. RemixJS, therefore,\nwas not just a tool but a new paradigm for managing data and UI performance.\n\n## Transitioning to Tailwind CSS\n\nMy journey with Tailwind CSS has been one of gradual understanding and\nadaptation. Initially, I wasn't a fan. Despite several attempts to engage with\nit and hearing passionate arguments from its proponents, my stance remained\nskeptical.\n\nMy previous projects used Tailwind, but I was never involved in the initial\nsetup or pattern establishment. This lack of deep involvement contributed to my\nreservations. When I finally decided to give Tailwind a proper chance,\nparticularly in setting it up from scratch, I was looking for a change in\nperspective.\n\nOne of the first things I realized was that Tailwind didn't significantly reduce\nthe amount of CSS I wrote. The argument that Tailwind eliminates the need to\nwrite CSS didn't hold up in practice; I still recall and apply CSS principles\nregularly. The comparison with my previous experience, where IDEs converted\nshorthand into full CSS rules, was stark. Tailwind didn't save me from typing;\nit just changed the syntax.\n\nIn addition, even though Tailwind CSS might be good enough for simple user\ninterface requirements, I faced certain restrictions when dealing with more\nintricate designs, particularly those that involve pseudo-elements that I often\nutilize. Consequently, I was advised to create custom CSS to address these\nlimitations, which was unexpected.\n\nHaving spent most of my career using pre-processed languages like SASS, which\nhave been game-changers regarding organization and composability, I appreciate\nframeworks that leverage native CSS capabilities. Tailwind presented a mixed bag\nin this regard - while it encouraged using underlying language features, its API\nand shortcuts felt less intuitive than other frameworks like Chakra UI.\n\n## Porting Angular 12 and GatsbyJS to Remix\n\nI decided to rewrite my website, which was previously built using Angular 12 and\nGatsbyJS, to Remix. The main reason behind this decision was to learn new\nframeworks and development approaches. My website features interactive canvas,\nlisting, and article detail pages, providing a practical ground for my\nexploration.\n\n![Isometric digital illustration of a multilayered data center with cloud computing icons, data blocks, and connectivity symbols in a blue color scheme.](angular-to-remix-3_nt6pcf.webp)\n\nWhile rewriting the interactive canvas, I had to adopt a more complex approach.\nInitially, I developed the canvas in Angular and converted the class-based logic\nto React's functional components without considering the unique requirements of\nthe interactive canvas. Therefore, I isolated the canvas into a class, which\nenabled the canvas to redraw without causing a re-render and maintaining the\nsame color palette for returning users. This aspect of the rewrite highlighted\nthe importance of understanding framework-specific nuances.\n\nI significantly improved build and compile times by switching to Remix and Vite.\nWhile **GatsbyJS took about one and a half minutes for a build, Remix took under\n30 seconds**, with Vite further reducing the initial local compile time.\n\nThis project wasn't just about using a new framework. It was a practical\nexperiment in adapting to different web technologies and methodologies.\n\n## Moving from Netlify to Vercel\n\nI have been using Netlify for years, both personally and professionally.\nHowever, I recently tried Vercel due to the hype around the platform. My\nexperience with Netlify has been primarily positive, with easy deployment and\nreliability, but I wanted to see what Vercel had to offer.\n\nVercel and Netlify have similar functionality, including easy rollbacks, simple\nconfiguration, and various templates. However, Vercel's user interface and\ninteraction design were slightly better than Netlify's. Remember that this\npreference is subjective and based on my experience and requirements, which\nmight differ from others.\n\nSwitching to Vercel was more about exploring an alternative than being\nunsatisfied with Netlify. Both platforms offer solid solutions for modern web\ndeployments, but Vercel's approach was more suited to my current project needs.\n\n---\n\nI rewrote my website using Remix and experimented with various tools such as\nVite, PNPM, and Vercel during this process. Each step taught me practical skills\nand knowledge, from tackling SSR with RemixJS to integrating Tailwind CSS and\nevaluating different hosting platforms.\n\nThis journey involved keeping up with the latest trends and understanding how\nthese technologies could benefit my work. It reinforced the idea that in web\ndevelopment, staying open to new tools and approaches is essential for\ncontinuous improvement and keeping pace with the industry's evolution.\n\nUltimately, this project was as instructive as it was functional, providing\ninsights that could be valuable to others navigating similar paths in web\ndevelopment.\n\nAnd that new build time… 🐎","src/content/blog/angular-gatsby-to-remix-transition.mdx","77d8e16dfedfee13","angular-url-encoding",{"id":46,"data":48,"body":56,"filePath":57,"digest":58,"deferredRender":27},{"title":49,"date":50,"tags":51,"description":53,"image":54,"draft":22,"readingTime":55},"Angular URL Encoding",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.220Z"],[52,35],"angularjs","Quickly encode or decode a URI using AngularJS","url-encoding.webp",1,"Recently a project I was working on required the ability to URL-encode various\nstrings in order to create `mailTo:` links on the fly.

However, finding the right balance between automated color\ngeneration and manual control can be challenging. Let's look at how you can\ncreate a color interpolator that generates a palette of colors between two\nspecified values.\n\n![A vivid display of colored panels in a gradient from yellow to deep blue, reminiscent of a carefully crafted color scale used in data visualization.](color-interpolator-for-data-visualization.webp)\n\n## The Need for a Custom Color Interpolator\n\nWhile experimenting with generated color palettes for a data visualization\nproject, we encountered a need for greater control over the color transitions.\nThe standard methods provided either too much automation or required extensive\nmanual input. Thus, the color interpolator was born out of necessity, providing\na solution that bridges this gap.\n\n## Core Concepts of the Color Interpolator\n\nThe color interpolator generates intermediate colors from two input colors. This\nprocess involves:\n\n- Defining a starting and an ending color in RGB format.\n- Specifying the number of steps or intermediate colors required.\n- Utilizing an interpolation function to blend the colors.\n\n### Implementation\n\nThe implementation involves two primary functions: `interpolateColor` and\n`interpolateColors`. `interpolateColor` blends two colors based on a given\nfactor, while `interpolateColors` generates an array of colors between the two\nspecified colors. The code snippet demonstrates the process in JavaScript,\napplicable for web-based data visualization.\n\n```typescript\n/**\n * Interpolate two colors\n *\n * @param color1 - The starting color\n * @param color2 - The end color\n * @param factor - The interpolation factor (default: 0.5)\n * @returns The interpolated color\n */\nfunction interpolateColor(\n  color1: number[],\n  color2: number[],\n  factor: number = 0.5\n): number[] {\n  if (color1.length !== color2.length) {\n    throw new Error('Color arrays must have the same length');\n  }\n\n  return color1.map((value, index) => {\n    const diff = color2[index] - value;\n    return Math.round(value + factor * diff);\n  });\n}\n\n/**\n * Create an array of color values between two colors\n *\n * @param color1 - The starting color in the format 'rgb(0, 0, 0)'\n * @param color2 - The end color in the format 'rgb(255, 255, 255)'\n * @param steps - The number of desired colors\n * @returns The array of interpolated color values\n */\nfunction interpolateColors(color1, color2, steps) {\n  const [r1, g1, b1] = color1.match(/\\d+/g).map(Number);\n  const [r2, g2, b2] = color2.match(/\\d+/g).map(Number);\n\n  const interpolatedColorArray = [];\n\n  for (let i = 0; i \u003C steps; i++) {\n    const factor = i / (steps - 1);\n    const [r, g, b] = interpolateColor([r1, g1, b1], [r2, g2, b2], factor);\n    interpolatedColorArray.push(`rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`);\n  }\n\n  return interpolatedColorArray;\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe usage involves:\n\n- Defining the start and end colors (`COLOR_ONE` and `COLOR_TWO`).\n- Setting the number of desired color steps (`STEPS`).\n- Applying the generated colors to HTML elements, in this case, divs within a\n  wrapper.\n\n\u003Cp\n  className=\"codepen\"\n  data-height=\"300\"\n  data-default-tab=\"js,result\"\n  data-slug-hash=\"rvMYMX\"\n  data-user=\"benjamincharity\"\n  style={{height: '300px', boxSizing: 'border-box', display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', border: '2px solid', margin: '1em 0', padding: '1em'}}\n>\n  \u003Cspan>\n    See the Pen{' '}\n    \u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io/benjamincharity/pen/rvMYMX\">\n      Interpolate colors\n    \u003C/a>{' '}\n    by Benjamin Charity (\n    \u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io/benjamincharity\">@benjamincharity\u003C/a>) on{' '}\n    \u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen\u003C/a>.\n  \u003C/span>\n\u003C/p>\n\n---\n\nThis color interpolator exemplifies how a simple yet powerful tool can\nsignificantly enhance the aesthetic and functional aspects of data\nvisualization.

Streamline choices, create intuitive interfaces, and enhance user engageme...","designing-products-impact-guide-10-laws-principles.webp","As a product builder, having knowledge of effective design shortcuts can be your\nbiggest asset. It's important to focus on practical, proven principles that can\nbe applied directly to your work. In this article, we'll provide you with ten\nessential psychological and design laws that cut through the noise. These laws\naren't just academic concepts but are practical tools that have been proven to\nwork in the real world. From Fitts’ Law, which ensures your app's buttons are in\nthe right spot, to the Law of Neural Adaptation, which helps keep your content\nfresh and engaging, these principles are your toolkit for creating products that\npeople love to use. So, let's dive in and explore how these laws can make your\nproduct more innovative, intuitive, and user-friendly.\n\n![A stack of UX books](designing-products-impact-guide-10-laws-principles.webp)\n\n## Laws and Principles:\n\n1. **Fitts’ Law**: This law states that the time to acquire a target is a\n   function of the distance to and size of the target. I optimize interface\n   layouts by placing buttons and interactive elements within easy reach and\n   ensuring they are appropriately sized.\n2. **Law of Neural Adaptation**: We tune out repetitive stimuli over time.\n   Product design refreshes content and features periodically to sustain user\n   interest.\n3. **Hick's Law**: The time it takes to make a decision increases with the\n   number and complexity of choices. I reduce choice overload in interfaces to\n   streamline navigation and enhance user experience.\n4. **Weber's Law**: The just-noticeable difference between two stimuli is\n   proportional to the magnitude of the stimuli. I ensure that interface changes\n   are perceptible without being too jarring.\n5. **Gall's Law**: All complex systems evolve from simpler versions that work. I\n   advocate for starting with a minimal viable product and building complexity\n   incrementally.\n6. **Miller's Law**: It states that the average person can only keep 7 (plus or\n   minus 2) items in their working memory. For UX, this implies designing\n   interfaces with manageable chunks of information or actions at a time.\n7. **Jakob's Law**: Users spend most of their time on other sites, meaning they\n   prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already\n   know. Consistency in design patterns and conventions is key.\n8. **Law of Prägnanz (Good Figure or Simplicity Law)**: People will perceive and\n   interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form(s) possible. This\n   law emphasizes the importance of simplicity and clarity in design.\n9. **Peak-End Rule**: People judge an experience based mainly on how they felt\n   at its peak (i.e., its most intense point) and at its end rather than the\n   total sum or average of every moment of the experience. This influences how\n   you design critical interactions or the conclusion of user journeys.\n10. **Law of Proximity**: Objects near or proximate to each other tend to be\n    grouped. This principle is essential in organizing information and design\n    elements effectively.\n\n---\n\nWe have discussed ten crucial laws that can significantly impact your product\ndesign. It's important to remember that **in a small company, every decision\ncounts, and implementing these principles can give you a competitive\nadvantage**. Use what we have discussed as your practical guide to streamline\nchoices, make your interfaces intuitive, and keep your users engaged. The key is\nto make intelligent and informed design choices that resonate with your users\nand differentiate your product in a crowded market. Keep these laws in mind as\nyou design and iterate. They're not just theories but your blueprint for\nbuilding products that function well and deliver a great user experience.","src/content/blog/designing-products-impact-guide-10-laws-principles.mdx","a3a487b2e3395c2c","definitive-career-paths-engineering",{"id":87,"data":89,"body":97,"filePath":98,"digest":99,"deferredRender":27},{"title":90,"date":91,"tags":92,"description":94,"image":95,"draft":22,"readingTime":96},"Engineering Career Clarity: Definitive Paths for ICs and Managers",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.221Z"],[17,18,93],"process","Explore the importance of defining distinct career trajectories for individual contributors (ICs) and managers within engineering teams. Learn how dual caree...","EngCareerPaths_ICs_Managers.webp",8,"In the evolving landscape of engineering, companies must delineate clear career\npaths. This article delves into the importance of establishing distinct\ntrajectories for individual contributors (ICs) and managers within engineering\nteams. Defining these paths is a blueprint for employee development and a\nstrategic move to harness talent effectively, fostering personal and\norganizational growth.\n\n![Graphical representation of distinct engineering career paths, with symbolic icons for individual contributors and managers set against a tech-inspired background](EngCareerPaths_ICs_Managers.webp)\n\n## Why offer both paths?\n\nOffering individual contributor (IC) and management paths is essential in talent\nmanagement, addressing diverse career aspirations, and optimizing workforce\npotential. **This dual-path strategy enhances employee satisfaction by\nrecognizing and valuing different strengths and career goals.** Employees feel\nmore connected and valued when their unique contributions and progression paths\nare acknowledged, leading to a more inclusive and motivating workplace\nenvironment.\n\nOptimized skill utilization is another key benefit of this approach. It allows\nfor the alignment of individual strengths with organizational needs. Delineating\nthese paths ensures that talented engineers and effective managers are in roles\nthat best suit their skills. This not only maximizes individual performance but\nalso boosts overall productivity and innovation within the company.\n\n**Clear career progression paths significantly impact retention.** When\nemployees see opportunities for advancement that align with their personal goals\nand skills, they are more likely to remain with the company. This is\nparticularly crucial for retaining highly skilled ICs who might not be\ninterested in a management track but are invaluable to the technical progress\nand stability of the company.\n\nImplementing these dual paths becomes even more critical at a growth inflection\npoint. As companies scale, the need for specialized roles and defined leadership\nincreases. Distinct career paths help scale the organization effectively,\nensuring that the right skills are in the right roles and that the company\nculture evolves while maintaining its core values.\n\n![Engineering Career Progression Flowchart: Technical and Leadership Tracks](Engineering-Career-Paths.webp?highres)\n\nSupporting very senior non-managers is also crucial. Senior ICs bring invaluable\nknowledge and experience to the technical side of the business. By valuing these\nroles, **companies leverage their expertise and demonstrate to all employees\nthat technical excellence is recognized and rewarded, independent of managerial\naspirations.**\n\n## Tech Lead\n\nIn the engineering team structure, the Tech Lead role stands out as a unique\nposition. **It's not a formal role on the individual contributor (IC) or manager\ntracks but a critical function that can be filled by members from either path.**\nThe Tech Lead focuses on enhancing team productivity and collective impact\nthrough practical technical skills and delegation.\n\nA Tech Lead scales technical expertise within the team and makes independent\ndecisions, contributing significantly to the team's and individual members'\ndevelopment.

This strategic approach has been\ninstrumental in fostering employee development and satisfaction. By providing\nclear progression routes and development opportunities, Salesforce has enhanced\nits team's skills and innovation potential and significantly contributed to its\nmarket success and customer satisfaction. This case underlines the importance of\nwell-structured career paths in aligning employee growth with organizational\ngoals.\n\nAnother illustration of the benefits of well-defined career paths can be seen at\nBain & Company. Here, the focus has been on creating clear, skills- and\ncompetency-based career paths. This approach begins with determining the\nnecessary skills and competencies for various roles or stages in a career.\nLeadership at Bain identifies training and professional development resources\navailable for employees to acquire these skills. **By making this information\ntransparent and consistently communicated, employees are better positioned to\nmake informed decisions and pursue growth opportunities within the company.**\n\nThis method is particularly effective in enhancing employee satisfaction and\nretention, especially among diverse and underrepresented workers. By documenting\ncareer paths and the skills needed for advancement and making this information\naccessible to all, Bain minimizes the potential for bias in promotion decisions.\nThis transparency ensures a more equitable and inclusive work environment where\nall employees have clear expectations and opportunities for career growth.\n\nLet's sum this up: Creating defined career paths for both ICs and managers in\nthe tech field is crucial, and it’s more than just a smart strategy. It's\ncritical for any tech company aspiring to grow and innovate. It is a practical\ntool for developing talent and sparking new ideas. Look at industry leaders like\nSalesforce and Bain & Company — their success isn't just luck but a testament to\nthe effectiveness of well-planned career trajectories.

While Spotify allows you to save tracks to your device for 'offline'\nlistening, I've found that the app needs at least some small amount of data\ntransfer just to start up. Which, in my eyes, kind of kills the primary benefit\nof having 'offline' tracks. This feature seems to be about saving bandwidth\nrather than listening to tracks with no cell service.\n\n![Headphones resting next to a laptop on a wooden desk symbolize the convenience of downloading music from Spotify for offline listening.](download-spotify-tracks.webp)\n\nI ran into a few issues getting it set up, so I thought I would post the\nsolutions in case it could help anyone else.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Homebrew:** The [Homebrew][homebrew] package manager should be installed.\n- **Spotify App Keys:** Download your Spotify premium developer app key. Find\n  your keys [here][spotify_keys].\n\n> Note: If you have not yet requested to be a Spotify developer, you will be\n> asked to do so before your keys are made accessible.\n\n## Setting the groundwork\n\n1. Update/upgrade Homebrew:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew update\n   brew upgrade\n   ```\n\n2. Install a few dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install homebrew/binary/libspotify lame sox eyeD3\n   ```\n\n3. Clone the [Spotijay repo][spotijay] to your desired location:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone git@github.com:alexperezpaya/Spotijay.git\n   ```\n\n4. CD into the directory that you just cloned:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd spotijay\n   ```\n\n5. Grab the Spotify app key that you downloaded earlier and place it inside this\n   directory.\n\n6. Install [NPM][npm] dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n7. Install [Forever][forever]. This is a tool that will keep the Spotijay script\n   running continuously.\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g forever\n   ```\n\n> Note: If you see an error on this step, you may need to install libspotify\n> from source. More info [here][install_error].\n\n## Configuring Spotijay\n\nNext we need to configure the app with Spotify authentication. For help, run:\n\n```bash\nnode app.js help\n```\n\nThis is where I ran into this error:\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/benjamincharity/df50392a38652534f4be.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nWe can see from this error message that we seem to be missing a file here:\n`/usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify`. Once we enter the `lib` directory:\n\n```bash\ncd /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/\n```\n\nYou should see these contents:\n\n```bash\npkgconfig/\nlibspotify.dylib\nlibspotify.12.dylib\nlibspotify.12.1.51.dylib\n```\n\n> Note: This was not my first attempt at getting libspotify installed. So I may\n> have more files listed here than you are seeing in your directory. The\n> important one is `libspotify.dylib`.\n\nNow, I'm not one to go changing file or directory names within library\ndirectories all willy-nilly, but after reading [this thread][libspotify_name] I\ndecided to give it a try. For safety's sake, I duplicated the\n`libspotify. dylib` file before changing the name. Then I simply removed the\n`.dylib` extension to match the file noted in the error message.\n\nJust like that, `node app.js help` worked beautifully.\n\nNext up, we need to run the spotijay config script:\n\n```bash\n                      a)               b)               c)\nnode app.js config -u your_username -p your_password -d ~/music_download\n```\n\nNothing too magical here. We are simply calling config on the app.js server and\npassing in our a) user name, b) password and c) the destination folder (where\nthe music will be saved).\n\nAt this point, you should be ready to begin downloading some music!\n\n## Running Spotijay\n\nThe Spotijay [documentation][spotijay_docs] references this command to begin:\n\n```bash\nforever start app.js playlist spotify:playlistURI\n```\n\nBut this did **not** work for me. I had to include my username in the call:\n\n```bash\nforever start app.js playlist spotify:user:MY_USERNAME:playlist:playlistURI\n```\n\n> **Note:** A playlist URI will be a string of random characters like this:\n> `5uSLUnV6U9easnPRO4rNu3`. The only way I know of to find the URI for a\n> playlist is to open the [Spotify web player][web_player] and navigate to the\n> desired playlist. In the browser address bar you should see a URL ending with\n> the current playlist's URI such as:\n> `https://play.spotify.com/user/your_username/playlist/5uSLUnV6U9easnPRO4rNu3`\n\nWhile the Spotijay documentation doesn't mention it, by looking at the [source\ncode][track] it seems that you can also download single tracks if you so desire.\n\n```bash\nforever start app.js track spotify:user:MY_USERNAME:track:trackURI\n```\n\n## Managing `Forever`\n\n```bash\n# See a list of all running forever process'\nforever list\n\n# Stop a process\nforever stop UID  # replace `UID` with the UID returned from `forever list`\n\n# Start a process\nforever start app.js playlist spotify:user:MY_USERNAME:playlist:playlistURI\n```\n\n## A few final notes\n\n- If your Spotify account is used from anywhere else, Forever's connection with\n  Spotify will be ended. Simply kill the Forever process and restart it.\n- Spotijay will only download files that are not found in the directory. So no\n  worries about duplicates when restarting process'.\n- When waking your computer from sleep, Forever will pick right back up where it\n  left off; no restart necessary.\n\nThe only other thing that I wish Spotijay did out of the box was support\ndifferent directories per playlist call. I'm sure it would not be hard to extend\nthe script (it's fairly small). Maybe I'll get around to that..someday.\n\n[spotijay]: https://github.com/alexperezpaya/Spotijay\n[homebrew]: https://brew.sh/\n[spotify_keys]: https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/\n[forever]: https://github.com/foreverjs/forever\n[install_error]: https://github.com/alexperezpaya/Spotijay/issues/3\n[libspotify_name]: https://github.com/alexperezpaya/Spotijay/issues/5\n[spotijay_docs]: https://github.com/alexperezpaya/Spotijay/blob/master/README.md\n[web_player]: https://play.spotify.com\n[track]: https://github.com/alexperezpaya/Spotijay/blob/master/app.js#L103-L111","src/content/blog/download-320kbps-mp3s-from-your-premium-spotify-account.mdx","4c22656edc0d38bf","css-bracket-formatting-styles",{"id":113,"data":115,"body":123,"filePath":124,"digest":125,"deferredRender":27},{"title":116,"date":117,"tags":118,"description":120,"image":121,"draft":22,"readingTime":122},"CSS Bracket Formatting Styles",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.221Z"],[119],"css","Examples of various formatting styles for CSS brackets.","css-bracket-formatting-styles.webp",2,"Ever wondered what the various \u003Cabbr title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS\u003C/abbr>\nbracket styles were called?

This guide covers balancing in-person and remote interactions, enhancing structure...","enhancing-team-connectivity-remote-work.webp","Building a cohesive and connected team can be challenging in the digital age,\nwhere remote work has become the norm. As an introvert, I've often debated the\nnecessity of in-person interactions. Yet, experience has shown that much like\nthe indispensable video calls, ongoing face-to-face contact is crucial for\nengagement and forging strong connections.\n\n![A person is engaging with colleagues through a video conference call on a laptop, highlighting the power of digital tools in maintaining connections in remote work settings.](enhancing-team-connectivity-remote-work.webp)\n\n## Balancing In-Person and Remote Interactions\n\nQuarterly in-person meetings are ideal for maintaining this balance, with a\nminimum of twice-yearly gatherings. Annual meetings are often reduced to nothing\nmore than a holiday party, which is insufficient for sustained team bonding and\nfocus.\n\n**Structured Communication: The Backbone of Small Organizations**\n\nImplementing regular, skip-level meetings is vital, especially in smaller\norganizations. These meetings provide varied communication channels,\nacknowledging that each team member brings unique experiences, emotions, and\nperspectives. In early-stage companies where communication is paramount, these\nmultiple pathways for expression are invaluable.\n\n## Transparency in Career Growth and Compensation\n\nEnsure transparency regarding the company's approach to employee growth from the\noutset. Clarify whether reviews and pay raises are annual or tied to funding\nmilestones. When transitioning from a solo founding team member to a team\nleader, specify if this role will be filled internally or through new hires.\nAcknowledge that early-stage employees might accept lower salaries, emphasizing\nthe career trajectory and personal development opportunities available to them\nwithin the company.\n\n## Recognition: Fuel for Motivation\n\nRecognition significantly boosts motivation and team morale, particularly for\nearly-stage employees fueled by passion. It's crucial to provide them with\nconsistent, positive feedback. Celebrating successes, especially those\nquantifiable through business metrics, should be a genuine and spontaneous act.\nRecognition can be conveyed through a dedicated Slack channel or during\nall-hands meetings, but it should always be voluntary and optional. For\ninstance, if recognition becomes a regular feature in every all-hands meeting,\nit risks becoming a routine search for fillers rather than properly\nacknowledging noteworthy achievements.\n\n## Accessibility of Information\n\nMaintain the accessibility of crucial information. Ensure that all-hand meeting\nupdates are communicated live and archived for future reference. Utilize a\nplatform like Notion to create a dedicated database under the company's general\npage for these updates. This approach **is a vital resource for new employees,\noffering them a broader perspective than just a company snapshot**. Moreover, it\nbecomes a cherished chronicle, painting a vivid story of the company's evolution\nand milestones, which can be nostalgically revisited as you stand atop the\npinnacle of success.\n\n## Encouraging Informal Interactions\n\nEncourage your team to engage in morning chitchat calls. Despite not being\nparticularly extroverted, one of the aspects I miss the most is the casual\nmorning conversations that naturally occur as everyone prepares for the day,\nsetting up their workstations and grabbing a coffee or water. In the virtual\nsetting, we've maintained this practice with brief 5 to 10-minute calls each\nmorning. These calls happen as we boot up our computers and review our daily\nschedules, preserving that essential early connection among team members.\n\n## Virtual Events: A Hit or Miss\n\nVirtual events are a mixed bag; some can be awkward, while others are\nexceptionally well-executed. They often lean towards the uncomfortable side.\nHowever, their success largely depends on investment - like the choice between\nbuilding your server or outsourcing it. Hosting events in-house may only be\nfeasible due to the rare skillset required. Therefore, investing in professional\nevent management can be a worthwhile expense.\n\nMonitoring attendance at these virtual events is essential, not to pressure team\nmembers into participating, but to gain insights into engagement levels. If\ncertain team members consistently skip events, it might indicate a need to\ndiversify the types of virtual events offered, ensuring they appeal to a broader\nrange of interests and preferences within your team.\n\n## Meeting Documentation for Future Reference\n\nMake it a practice to record the majority of meetings. Ideally, both the\ntranscript and a video link should be accessible in the meeting notes section of\nyour chosen wiki system. This approach is beneficial for current team members,\nwho often juggle a vast amount of information, but it's also invaluable for new\nteam members. These readily available resources can significantly streamline\nonboarding, allowing newcomers to quickly catch up on past discussions and\nintegrate more seamlessly into the team's workflow. By providing these easily\naccessible resources, you alleviate the cognitive load for all team members,\nallowing them to focus more effectively on their immediate tasks.\n\n## Balancing Engagement and Focus\n\nIt's crucial to balance engagement with the risk of it becoming an annoyance.\nTherefore, we must ensure enough time between engagement activities for focused\nand uninterrupted work. This approach respects the individual's need for\nproductivity and personal space, maintaining a healthy work environment.\n\n## Democratizing Information\n\nFoster a culture where sharing resources becomes a natural response to any\nquestion. **In successful organizations, the democratization of information is\ncritical.** Whenever knowledge is extracted from someone's expertise, it should\nbe documented and made accessible for future reference. Establishing this\nculture of open resource sharing from the outset is essential, ensuring that it\nis perceived as a helpful practice rather than a passive-aggressive gesture akin\nto \"Let Me Google That For You\" (LMGTFY). This approach streamlines knowledge\ntransfer and builds a foundation of collective intelligence within the\norganization.\n\n## Anonymous Feedback Channels\n\nEstablish a channel for anonymous feedback, even in a small company of just five\npeople. Implementing this early on is beneficial, despite it seeming unnecessary\nat first. While the ideal is to cultivate a team that communicates openly and\ntrusts each other, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexity of individual\npersonalities. Setting up a system for anonymous feedback is a minor initial\ninvestment that can significantly enhance comfort levels in providing honest\nfeedback at all times, fostering a more inclusive and understanding work\nenvironment.\n\n## Inclusivity in Remote Meetings\n\nThis will be fine if your organization prioritizes remote-first operations.\nHowever, in cases where team members join meetings remotely, it's ideal for all\nparticipants to connect individually via video. The dynamic shifts significantly\nwhen some team members are together on-site, sharing a single camera, while\nothers join from different locations, each on their camera. This scenario can\ncreate disparities in the meeting experience, emphasizing the importance of\nindividual video participation to maintain a consistent and inclusive dynamic.\n\n## Respecting Diverse Work Environments\n\nThe requirement for a professional background in video calls may vary depending\non a team member's role. However, it's beneficial to encourage natural,\nunaltered backgrounds across the board. Only some have the luxury of a dedicated\nworkspace at home, which should never lead to feelings of shame or inadequacy.\nInstead, **we should promote a culture where team members feel comfortable\nsharing their surroundings.** Since early-stage employees often work beyond the\ntypical 9 to 5 schedule, this practice aligns with bringing \"your whole self to\nwork.\" Embrace those moments when a child or pet unexpectedly appears in the\nbackground. These instances allow us to share a laugh and connect more\npersonally with each other's lives.\n\n## Interactive All-Hands Meetings\n\nConclude every all-hands meeting with a fun company trivia quiz. The meeting\nleader questions the company's history, operations, or industry-specific\nacronyms. Participants type their answers, and the first to respond correctly\nwins a small prize. This could involve anything from deciphering industry\nacronyms to recalling key company milestones, like who the first customer was,\nor details about significant events, such as the most extensive system outage.\nThis engaging activity fosters team bonding and enhances everyone's knowledge\nabout the company.\n\n## Career Path Clarity for Employees\n\nHave a clear vision for your employees' career paths. Many founders hire\nprimarily to fill immediate roles, focusing on the company's next steps.\nHowever, it's equally important to consider the future trajectory of your early\nemployees. Determine whether they form the stable core around which you'll build\nor if they are potential leaders for whom you'll hire support staff. **While\nemployees often have their career aspirations, as a founder, you should also\nhave a plan for the evolution of their roles.** Aligning these visions is\ncrucial; a mismatch might indicate a poor fit. Moreover, with established\nexpectations and goals from the outset, the future of these roles can be smooth\nand directionless.\n\n## Regular Check-Ins and Software Assessments\n\nConduct regular check-ins about work hours and continually assess satisfaction\nwith tools and software. Employees often know about the latest and most\nefficient tools, and upgrading can significantly improve productivity and\nmorale.\n\n## Encouraging Physical Activity in Meetings\n\nEncouraging one-on-one walking meetings can be highly advantageous for several\nreasons. Firstly, it helps ease the discomfort of silence during conversations,\nfostering more natural and relaxed interactions. Additionally, it promotes\nphysical activity, contributing to the overall well-being of both participants.\n\n## Promoting Employee Wellness Through Flexible Stipends\n\nI recommend offering a wellness stipend to your employees, allowing them to\nutilize it for physical or mental health purposes. This should be implemented to\nensure employees don't have to disclose whether it was used for mental health or\nother wellness needs, preserving their privacy and promoting a supportive work\nenvironment.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, **the key to thriving in remote work lies in balancing structured\ncommunication with the flexibility of digital interactions.** Regular in-person\nmeetings complement our digital connections, fostering a more profound sense of\ncommunity. We create a motivating and trustworthy environment by promoting\ntransparency in career growth and compensation and recognizing achievements.\n**Maintaining easy access to information is essential, encouraging a culture of\nshared knowledge and inclusivity.**\n\nInteractive elements like morning chats and trivia quizzes in all-hands meetings\nengage and build a collective understanding of our company's journey. Regular\nfeedback, attention to employee wellness, and respect for diverse work\nenvironments are fundamental to nurturing a supportive and productive remote\nworkplace. By continuously adapting to our team's needs and valuing open\ncommunication, we ensure our collective success and individual satisfaction,\nmaking our remote work environment functional and exceptional.","src/content/blog/enhancing-team-connectivity-remote-work.mdx","f1b19910592d0aec","essential-questions-for-joining-early-stage-startups",{"id":140,"data":142,"body":150,"filePath":151,"digest":152,"deferredRender":27},{"title":143,"date":144,"tags":145,"description":147,"image":148,"draft":22,"readingTime":149},"Essential Questions for Joining Early-Stage Startups",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.222Z"],[133,132,146],"interviewing","Empower your career decisions with these essential questions for joining early-stage startups.

I was struck by how interesting it was to watch small changes in a person\nover time. So I thought I would try to do something similar.\n\nUnfortunately, I knew there was no way I could remember to take a picture every\nday. Even if I could, it would quickly become one more task to complete in my\nalready packed days. I needed a way to automate the process.\n\nA bit later I learned about [Git Hooks][6] and saw someone who used git hooks to\ntake a webcam picture. (I unfortunately cannot remember where I first saw this,\nor I would credit them...)\n\n## A git commits timeline\n\nI created a post-commit git hook that would take a picture with the built-in\nwebcam immediately after each commit. It's as simple as creating a file inside\nyour project's `.git/hooks` directory named `post-commit`. Chances are, there\nare some samples already in that directory.\n\nInside the `post-commit` file paste this snippet:\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\nfile=\"~/Dropbox/gitshots/#{Time.now.to_i}.jpg\nputs \"Taking capture into #{file}!\nsystem \"imagesnap -q -w 3 #{file}\nexit 0\n```\n\nLines 2, 3 and 4 are the ones we need to focus on.\n\nLine #2 defines where the new image will be saved. I use a [Dropbox][1] folder\nfor this which allows me to work from multiple machines and have all git shots\nsaved together. The `#{Time.now.to_i}` bit creates a file name based on the\ncurrent time. This makes sure that each file has a unique name and is easily\nkept in the correct order.\n\nLine #3 prints a message to the console with the file name each time the script\nruns.\n\nLine #4 takes the actual picture and saves it to the path and filename that was\ndefined in line #2.\n\n## Creating a movie or Gif.\n\nIf you want to create a movie or gif from your `gitshots`, you will need to\ninstall [ImageMagick][2]. ImageMagick is a powerful image editing and\ntransformation tool that offers us some command line functionality.\n\nIf you are a [homebrew][3] user, simply brew install:\n\n```bash\nbrew install imagemagick\n```\n\nOnce the ImageMagick installation completes, navigate into your `gitshots`\ndirectory and run this command:\n\n```bash\nconvert -quality 100 -delay 30 *.jpg _myGifName.gif\n```\n\nOr for a movie:\n\n```bash\nconvert -quality 100 -delay 30 *.jpg _myMovieName.mp4\n```\n\nThis will run a [conversion][4] with the quality set to 100 with a [delay of 30\nticks per second][5] between each image. Every JPG in the current directory will\nbe used, and the output file will be saved in the same directory with the name\n`_movie.mp4`.\n\n**Note:** In my own tests the video always seems to have a render error about\n4/5 of the way through. I've tried using fewer images or lowering the quality\nwith no luck. If any of you know the reason, I'd love to know why!\n\n## Automate the post-commit creation.\n\nCopying our new `post-commit` file into every new repo will become tiresome very\nquickly. Luckily Git allows us to create templates that all new git repos will\nbe initialized with.\n\nTemplates for git hooks live in `~/.git_template/hooks/`. Simply drop in your\n`post-commit` file and the next time `git init` is run in a directory, the git\nrepo will include this post commit function.\n\n## The finished product\n\nSince the video creation wouldn't work, here is a sample Gif:\n\n![Short example from my gitshot year in review](2014_gitshots.gif)\n\n[1]: https://dropbox.com\n[2]: https://www.imagemagick.org\n[3]: https://brew.sh/\n[4]: https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php\n[5]: https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#delay\n[6]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks","src/content/blog/git-commits-year-in-review.mdx","ac09462b102cf041","ever-wondered-where-the-title-ux-originated",{"id":166,"data":168,"body":173,"filePath":174,"digest":175,"deferredRender":27},{"title":169,"date":170,"tags":171,"description":172,"draft":22,"readingTime":55},"Ever Wondered Where the Title UX Originated?",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.223Z"],[79],"Donald Norman coined the term 'UX' during his time at Apple in the 90s.","It seems we can track it back to the early 1990s at Apple.

My assertion is that the time it takes an\naverage user to create a palette of ten colors that looks even passable, far\noutweighs the benefit of such granular control. (Lord knows, you shouldn't have\n10 completely different colors on one page)\n\n> **The Idea:** Cut back user input to 3 colors and programmatically create\n> logical ancillary colors.\n\n_Colors defined by the user:_\n\n```scss\n$primary: #333;\n$secondary: #fafafa;\n$accent: blue;\n```\n\n\u003Csmall>**Note:** I will be using Sass throughout this article.\u003C/small>\n\nThe first case I decided to tackle was our buttons. I needed to make sure that\nthe button text was always easily readable over the button's background color.\n\nThe first method that came to mind was to make use of the powerful [color\nfunctions within sass][colorfunctions]. Using the `darken()` function I could\ncreate a text color that is, say, 40 % darker than the original color quite\neasily:\n\n```scss {5}\n$color: lightblue;\n\nbutton {\n  background-color: $color;\n  color: darken($color, 60%);\n}\n```\n\nNot too shabby. We've got a light blue background, and a nice dark text that\nstill has a hint of blue.\n\n## The first issue\n\nI immediately ran into an issue. Because we have no restrictions on the original\ncolor (`lightblue` in our case) a user could potentially set the base color to a\ndark color like black. Of course darkening our text color won't help us at all\nin this instance.\n\nThis time we can make use of the Sass `lightness()` function. This will return\nthe lightness value of the color (a numerical value between 0-100). The function\nbelow tests for the lightness of the initial color and will lighten or darken\nour text color depending on that value.\n\n```scss\n$lightness-bound: 70 !global;\n\n@function checkLightness($color) {\n  @if (lightness($color) > $lightness-bound) {\n    @return darken($color, 60);\n  } @else {\n    @return lighten($color, 60);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\u003Csmall>\n  NOTE: the `!global` declaration is new as of Sass 3.3. Remove this declaration\n  if you are on an earlier version of Sass.\n\u003C/small>\n\n## The second issue\n\nWhat if the user sets the initial color to yellow? While true yellow is below\nour threshold for lightness (yellow comes in at 50% lightness), a lighter text\nwill still be incredibly hard to read. Yes, we all hope they don't use bright\nyellow...but, we both know _someone_ will.\n\nAfter trying color after color I came up with what I call [The Danger\nZone][dangerzone] of the HSL color space.\n\n![A color spectrum diagram ranging from red to blue with varying lightness, labeled 'Hue' on the horizontal axis and 'Lightness' on the vertical axis, featuring a 'DANGER ZONE' overlay across the lighter hues.](hsl_vmazor.webp)\n\n**Lightness is defined on a vertical scale from 0 to 100 while Hue is defined on\na horizontal scale from 0&deg; to 360&deg;.**\n\nWe need to know when a color lands in this 'danger zone' and when it doesn't.\nWhen the initial color is within the danger zone we will darken the text color,\nand when the initial color is not in the danger zone we will lighten the text\ncolor.\n\n```scss\n$lightness-bound: 70 !global;\n$hue-bound-bottom: 40 !global;\n$hue-bound-top: 200 !global;\n\n@function checkDangerZone($color) {\n  @if (\n    (lightness($color) > $lightness-bound) or\n      (hue($color) > $hue-bound-bottom and hue($color) \u003C $hue-bound-top)\n  ) {\n    @return darken(desaturate($color, 70), 60);\n  } @else {\n    @return lighten(desaturate($color, 50), 60);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou will notice that I have also added the `desaturate()` function to this\nsolution. This tones down the actual color (yellow/red/etc.) and allows our\n`darken()` and `lighten()` functions to move our text color closer to white or\nblack. (I rarely see a use case for light red text on a dark red background.)\n\nPlay around with the final function in another [SassMeister Gist][finaltry].\n\n---\n\nThere it is.

I get it—turning an idea into reality is daunting,\nespecially when budgets are tight. But here’s some good news: there’s a world of\nfree tools and services that can help you get started, even if your wallet is\nfeeling a little light.\n\n![We heart founders mug.](we_heart_founders.webp)\n\nAs someone currently exploring ideas for my own SaaS project, I’ve spent a lot\nof time researching ways to make it happen without breaking the bank. Along the\nway, **I discovered an incredible range of platforms offering free tiers that\nare perfect for early-stage startups.** From hosting to user management to\nanalytics, these tools are designed to get your project off the ground with\nminimal upfront investment.\n\nNow, to be clear: this isn’t an exhaustive list. There are plenty of other great\nresources out there, but the tools I’ve compiled here are some of the best I’ve\nfound—generous free tiers that offer real value for scrappy founders.\n\n## Why Free Tools Are a Smart Choice for SaaS Founders\n\nStarting with free services isn’t just about saving money—it’s about launching\nsmarter. Here’s why free tiers make sense:\n\n### 1. Risk-Free Experimentation\n\nWhen your idea is still in its early stages, the last thing you want is to\ncommit big dollars to a platform you might outgrow or abandon. **Free tools let\nyou iterate and experiment without financial stress.**\n\n### 2. Top-Quality Resources\n\nMany of these free tools are the same ones used by tech giants and successful\nstartups. You’re not settling for scraps—you’re leveraging cutting-edge tech to\nfuel your growth.\n\n### 3. Room to Grow\n\nThese platforms know that today’s scrappy startups could be tomorrow’s big\nspenders. That’s why they offer free plans to help you get started—and\naffordable upgrades for when you’re ready to scale.\n\n## How I Picked These Tools\n\nWhen I started researching free tools, I had a clear checklist in mind. I was\nlooking for platforms that:\n\n- **Offered significant free-tier value** for startups, not just trial periods.\n- **Covered the essential categories** for launching and running a SaaS\n  business, like hosting, databases, and analytics.\n- **Are scalable**, so I wouldn’t need to completely overhaul my setup as my\n  project grew.\n\nThe result? A curated collection of tools that can power your SaaS project\nwithout draining your resources. While it’s not every free tool out there, it’s\na great starting point for any founder looking to bootstrap smartly.\n\n## The (Non-Exhaustive) List of Free Tools for SaaS Startups\n\nHere’s the list of tools I’ve uncovered during my research, grouped by category\nfor easy reference.

It is stepping into leadership for the first time. Most engineers underestimate just how different the job becomes once you stop being judged on your commits.\n\n![Eight rowers in a racing shell move in sync while a coxswain at the back calls direction on calm water.](leadership-transition-trip-ups.webp)\n\n## The Problem\n\nMany engineers approach the move from senior IC to director as if it is a straightforward promotion. They assume they will simply scale their impact. In practice, they either:\n\n- Keep trying to lead by being the super-engineer, reviewing every PR and making every big decision.\n- Or they overcompensate, leaning so hard into process that their team feels micromanaged and disconnected.\n\nBoth approaches fail. The real challenge is that the skills that made you valuable as an IC do not map neatly to leadership. In fact, they can actively work against you.\n\n## Why This Transition Is So Tough\n\nThe trap is simple: you try to keep doing what made you successful. But leadership is a different sport entirely.\n\n- **Managing peers who are no longer peers.** Yesterday you were shoulder to shoulder in the trenches. Today you are setting their growth paths.\n- **Changing your scoreboard.** As an engineer, success is building. As a director, success is enabling. If you do not adjust your lens, it can feel like you are doing nothing.\n- **Earning trust in new rooms.** Technical mastery earns credibility with engineers. In executive discussions, the currency is alignment, tradeoffs, and business impact.\n\nThis is why so many stumble: they keep trying to win the old game while playing a new one.\n\n## How to Survive (and Thrive) in the Transition\n\n### 1. Redefine Success\n\nYour value is not in writing code anymore. It is in creating the environment where others do their best work. Shift your scoreboard from \"what I built\" to \"what my team accomplished.\n\n### 2. Expand Your Time Horizon\n\nEngineers solve for sprints. Directors solve for quarters. You need to anticipate hiring needs, technical debt cliffs, and roadmap collisions months in advance and shield your team from being blindsided.\n\n### 3. Learn to Say No\n\nFocus is oxygen. Your credibility as a leader grows when you protect your team's bandwidth. Saying no, or \"not yet,\" is one of the most valuable tools in your kit.\n\n### 4. Manage Relationships, Not Tasks\n\nFormer peers do not need you in their tickets. They need clarity, fair evaluations, and honest career conversations. Your new job is building trust and alignment, not logging more commits.\n\n### 5. Speak the Language of the Business\n\nExecutives do not care about story points. They care about revenue, risk, and runway. Learn to translate technical debt into opportunity cost and roadmap risk. That is how you secure budgets and headcount.\n\n## The Hard Truth About Technical Depth\n\nTechnical mastery is necessary, but it is rarely what makes or breaks a company.\n\nI have seen technically pristine teams collapse because they could not align with product, retain talent, or agree on priorities. I have also seen beautifully engineered, technically complex products fail simply because no one wanted to use them. On the other hand, I have watched teams with scrappy, imperfect systems thrive for years because leadership kept them aligned, trusted, and focused.\n\n**Technical depth gets you in the room. Staying in the room, and moving the company forward, comes from clarity, focus, and trust.**\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nThis transition is not going away. As companies grow, the gap between technical depth and organizational leverage only widens. The leaders who thrive will not be the ones out-coding their teams. They will be the ones who connect engineering effort directly to business outcomes while keeping their teams motivated and focused.\n\nThe biggest trap in moving from engineer to director is trying to scale yourself. You do not scale, you change. **Success is no longer what you build, but what you enable.**\n\n## Call to Action\n\nIf you are staring down this transition, start small. Pick one thing this week you will stop doing yourself and instead enable someone else to own. That is the beginning of the shift.","src/content/blog/leadership-transition-engineers-director.mdx","ea729799c2f015d0","markdown-test-document",{"id":251,"data":253,"body":259,"filePath":260,"digest":261,"deferredRender":27},{"title":254,"date":255,"tags":256,"description":257,"image":258,"draft":22,"readingTime":162},"Markdown Test Document",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.225Z"],[34,35,36],"Creating a comprehensive Markdown page that includes all possible GitHu","TestImage.webp","Creating a comprehensive Markdown page that includes all possible GitHub\nMarkdown elements can serve as an invaluable resource for documentation, project\nREADMEs, and more.

Whether it’s launching a new\nproject or building IKEA furniture (we've all been there), the allure of\nperfection can be intoxicating. But here’s the rub: perfection is more a lottery\nthan a skill, and betting on a perfect outcome often costs more than it’s worth.\nOver-planning can lull us into a false sense of control, but in reality, it can\nlead to wasted resources, frustration, and a never-ending cycle of rework.\n\n![Desk with a crumpled complex blueprint on the left and a clean, simple plan using sticky notes on the right.](overplanning-hero.webp)\n\nWhat if the real magic lies not in striving for perfection but in finding the\nbalance between planning and flexibility?\n\n## The Gamble of Perfection\n\nPicture this: you map out a detailed project plan, accounting for every possible\nvariable. You’re convinced this is _the_ masterstroke. But as soon as reality\nhits, that plan crumbles faster than a house of cards in a wind tunnel. Why?\nBecause the perfect plan is a unicorn—it looks great in theory but rarely exists\nin practice.\n\nSure, when a meticulously planned project succeeds, it feels like a win for the\nages. But let’s face it: these moments are rare. **For every success story,\nthere are countless tales of over-planning gone wrong,** leaving behind a trail\nof wasted effort and dashed hopes.\n\n## The Trap of Over-Planning\n\nEver spent hours strategizing in games like _Factorio_ or _City Skylines_?\nYou’re not alone. It’s oddly satisfying to create intricate blueprints, only to\nrealize later that half of them are unusable because you didn’t account for,\nsay, power supply needs or traffic bottlenecks. Similarly, in real-life\nprojects, over-planning can feel productive but often leads to diminishing\nreturns.\n\nThe lesson? A detailed plan is only as good as its flexibility. Whether in\npersonal projects or business, over-planning locks us into rigid paths, leaving\nlittle room to adapt when things inevitably change.\n\n## Simplification and Its Discontents\n\n“Keep it simple.”\n\nEasy advice, right?\n\nBut here’s the catch: **oversimplifying can be just as problematic.** Imagine\ndesigning a system with only immediate needs in mind. Sure, it works for now,\nbut what happens when you need to scale or add features? Retrofitting an overly\nsimple foundation is like trying to add a second story to a house built on\nsand—frustrating and expensive.\n\nThe key isn’t in choosing simplicity or complexity but in knowing where to draw\nthe line. Build with the future in mind, but **don’t over-engineer for a future\nthat may never come.**\n\n## Finding the Middle Ground\n\nThe secret to efficient planning? **Build less, but plan for more.** This\napproach means focusing on essentials while leaving room for growth and change.\nIt’s like planting a tree: you can’t control how tall it will grow, but you can\nensure the soil is fertile and the roots have space to spread.\n\n**Strategies for striking this balance include:**\n\n- **Iterative planning:** Break projects into smaller, manageable phases.\n- **Scenario thinking:** Anticipate possible changes without committing to them.\n- **Flexible frameworks:** Design processes that can evolve over time.\n\n## Case Study: Basecamp’s Balanced Approach\n\nBasecamp, originally a small web design firm, transitioned into a leading\nproject management software provider by embodying balanced planning. Instead of\ntrying to do it all, they focused on solving their target audience’s core pain\npoints with a simple, user-friendly product. By planning effectively while\nstaying adaptable, Basecamp avoided the pitfalls of over-complication and\npositioned themselves for sustainable growth.\n\nHere’s how they align with the principles we’ve discussed:\n\n- **Simplification:** They prioritized core features, avoiding unnecessary\n  bloat.\n- **Flexibility:** Basecamp evolved its offerings to meet user needs over time.\n- **Strategic planning:** They built a **foundation for scalability without\n  overcommitting to specific outcomes.**\n\n---\n\nPlanning isn’t about creating a perfect blueprint; it’s about laying the\ngroundwork for success while embracing the inevitable twists and turns. By\nfinding the balance between structure and adaptability, you can avoid the\nextremes of over-planning and oversimplification, ensuring your projects are\nboth resilient and effective.\n\n## Actionable Next Steps to Master Balanced Planning\n\n### How to Tell If You’re Over-Planning\n\n#### 1. Your plans look like a doctoral thesis.\n\nIf your project outline includes a 50-slide presentation for a task that could\nbe explained in a two-paragraph email, you might be over-planning.\n\n#### 2. Execution keeps getting delayed.\n\nAre you stuck in endless preparation phases, tweaking every little detail? If\nyou’re struggling to start because the plan “isn’t perfect yet,” you’ve hit\nover-planning territory.\n\n#### 3. You’re constantly revising the plan.\n\nPlans are meant to guide action—not be the action. If you’re constantly\nadjusting the plan instead of executing it, it’s a clear sign you’ve gone too\nfar.\n\n#### 4. Team members seem confused or disengaged.\n\nOverly complicated plans can overwhelm or frustrate your team. If their feedback\nsounds like, “Can we just start already?” it’s time to rethink your approach.\n\n#### 5. You’re planning for every hypothetical scenario.\n\nWhile anticipating challenges is smart, trying to account for every possible\n“what if” can bog you down and make your plan unmanageable.\n\n### Strategies to Avoid Over-Planning\n\n#### 1. Set a Time Limit for Planning.\n\nAllocate a specific amount of time for the planning phase, such as 20% of the\nproject timeline. Once you hit that mark, shift your focus to execution.\n\n#### 2. Use the 80/20 Rule.\n\nIdentify the 20% of planning that will address 80% of the project’s needs. Focus\non the essentials and save the details for later iterations.\n\n#### 3. Create a Minimum Viable Plan (MVP).\n\nStart with a simple, functional plan that outlines key milestones and\ndeliverables. Treat it as a living document you can adapt as the project\nunfolds.\n\n#### 4. Adopt Iterative Planning.\n\nUse frameworks like Agile, Scrum, or Kanban, which emphasize smaller, manageable\nphases and regular check-ins to reassess goals and progress.\n\n#### 5. Rely on Quick Decision Filters.\n\nUse simple filters like, “Does this step directly move us closer to the goal?”\nIf not, consider leaving it out of the plan.\n\n#### 6. Test Before Over-Committing.\n\nRun small experiments or pilot versions of your project to gather feedback and\nadjust your approach. This can help reduce unnecessary planning up front.\n\n### Questions to Ask Yourself Regularly\n\n#### Am I delaying action in pursuit of the “perfect plan”?\n\nIf yes, remember: **done is better than perfect.**\n\n#### Have I accounted for flexibility?\n\nA rigid plan may collapse when things change. Build in room to adapt.\n\n#### Does the plan empower or overwhelm my team?\n\n**Your plan should serve as a guide, not a bottleneck.**\n\n#### Are my priorities clear?\n\nIf your plan tries to address _everything_, it ends up prioritizing _nothing_.\nFocus on high-impact tasks.\n\n### Course-Correcting When You’ve Over-Planned\n\n#### 1. Trim the Fat:\n\nReview your current plan and strip out unnecessary details or steps that don’t\ndirectly contribute to the project’s goals.\n\n#### 2. Reassess Milestones:\n\nAre there milestones that could be simplified or combined? Adjust your timeline\nto focus on progress rather than perfection.\n\n#### 3. Engage Your Team:\n\nGet feedback from your team to identify pain points in the plan. Sometimes,\nfresh eyes can quickly spot over-complications.\n\n#### 4. Shift Focus to Action:\n\nPick one piece of the plan and execute it immediately. **Momentum is a powerful\nantidote to over-planning.**\n\n#### 5. Set Deadlines for Decisions:\n\nIf you’re stuck in decision paralysis, commit to making key decisions by a\ncertain date, even if all the details aren’t perfect.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, you’ll not only avoid the pitfalls of over-planning\nbut also create plans that are actionable, adaptable, and aligned with your\ngoals.\n\n⚖️ Now go forth and strike that balance like a pro!\n\n## Additional Resources & Further Reading\n\n- _[The Paralysis of Perfection: Why Overthinking Kills Startups](https://www.starthawk.io/blog/post/the-paralysis-of-perfection-why-overthinking-kills-startups)_\n  by StartHawk\n- _[Overcoming Decision Paralysis in Business Start-Ups](https://medium.com/@marcneal/overcoming-decision-paralysis-in-business-start-ups-9863b84e8286)_\n  by Marc Neal\n- _Getting Things Done_ by David Allen\n- _Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time_ by Jeff Sutherland\n- Explore tools like Notion, Trello, Miro, FigJam and Basecamp for practical\n  planning support.","src/content/blog/master-balanced-planning-avoid-overplanning.mdx","90a72675272a428f","mastering-ambiguity-early-stage-companies",{"id":286,"data":288,"body":295,"filePath":296,"digest":297,"deferredRender":27},{"title":289,"date":290,"tags":291,"description":292,"image":293,"draft":22,"readingTime":294},"Mastering Ambiguity: Thriving in Early-Stage Companies",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.226Z"],[17,133,93,279,132],"This guide explores navigating startup uncertainties, drawing on over a decade of experiences.

Embracing these challenges\nunlocks growth and opportunities for innovation. Simultaneously innovating and\nadapting in rapidly changing circumstances allows individuals to turn obstacles\ninto stepping stones for success, creating a dynamic environment ripe for growth\nand learning.\n\n### Thriving in Ambiguity\n\n**Ambiguity often receives negative connotations, yet it can fuel creativity and\ninnovation. By embracing this mindset, we transform potential threats into\nopportunities,** highlighting the significance of resilience and adaptability.\nSuccess stories exemplify the benefits of welcoming uncertainty, such as\nmastering a new ecosystem to incorporate a point-of-sale system or investigating\nto uncover the limitations of new devices. These actions result in concrete\noutcomes and personal development. Ultimately, this approach improves our\nproblem-solving abilities and creativity.\n\n### The Downside of Ambiguity\n\nIt is important to understand that not all uncertainty is helpful. It is\nnecessary to differentiate between constructive ambiguity and destructive chaos.\nIndications of dysfunction, such as continuous miscommunication or a lack of\nguidance, necessitate a more organized approach.

This section discusses strategies for mitigating risks and\nnavigating early technology adoption, including research, pilot testing, and\nincremental implementation. Ultimately, **the success of new technology is\ndetermined by user perception.**\n\n## Building a Hipster Monorepo\n\n\u003Csmall>_before it was cool_\u003C/small>\n\nIn 2017, I was appointed to lead a UX engineering team at a company. We\nundertook an ambitious project to centralize our front-end ecosystem into a\nmonorepo. This was a year before the debut of NX or Lerna, two pivotal tools in\nmonorepo management. Our task was to consolidate front-end design systems, token\ngeneration, data services, shared UI components, and company-wide linting and\ntesting configurations. During the first year, we focused on fine-tuning our\ncontinuous integration (\u003Cabbr title=\"Continuous Integration\">CI\u003C/abbr>) and\ndeployment (\u003Cabbr title=\"Continuous Deployment\">CD\u003C/abbr>) processes while\nbuilding out the system's base. Since our team was relatively small, it was\ncrucial to streamline our workflows to avoid becoming a bottleneck in the\ndevelopment process.\n\n### Pioneering in Process Optimization\n\nCreating a unified codebase for all front-end systems was a new endeavor for us,\nespecially without the luxury of modern monorepo tools.

Choose an Audience Type\n\nEmbarking on the journey of understanding a new product, the first port of call\nis identifying the primary users. This is a crucial step as it sets the tone for\neverything that follows. Whether the users are within your organization or end\nconsumers, each group has unique needs and preferences. For instance, if your\nproduct is a software application used by graphic designers, their needs will\ndiffer significantly from those of accountants using the same software. By\ngetting to grips with who the users are, you can better tailor the product's\ndesign, functionality, and communication strategies to meet their specific\nrequirements. It’s about stepping into their shoes to see the product from their\nperspective, understanding their daily challenges, and figuring out how your\nproduct can make their lives easier.\n\n## 2. List the Tasks They Perform Daily\n\nOnce you have a clear picture of your audience, the next step is to dive deeper\ninto their world. This means identifying the tasks they perform daily with your\nproduct. Such an exercise goes beyond just listing tasks; it’s about\nunderstanding the significance of these tasks in the users' daily workflow. Are\nthey using your product for data analysis, for communication, or perhaps for\ncreative work?\n\n![A detailed view of project management in action, showcasing a team member analyzing a user journey map to optimize the project's user flow.](map-user-flow_i0la2n.webp)\n\nUnderstanding these tasks helps you pinpoint the product's most crucial features\nand functions. Methods like user interviews, feedback surveys, or analyzing\nusage data can be invaluable in gaining these insights. This phase is about\nbuilding empathy with your users, understanding what a day in their life looks\nlike, and how your product fits into that picture.\n\n## 3. Break a Task Out Into a User Flow\n\nHaving identified the essential tasks, the next stage is zooming in further.\nPick a task and dissect it into a detailed user flow. This involves mapping out\neach step the user takes to complete the task. Such a breakdown is instrumental\nin understanding the user experience granularly. Where are the pain points?\nWhere does the user experience delight? This insight is precious for product\ndevelopers and support teams as it helps identify areas for improvement. By\ndeconstructing a task into a user flow, you're not just looking at what users\nare doing but also how they are doing it, which is often where the most valuable\ninsights are found.\n\nLet’s apply this to a well-known brand like Starbucks and dissect a common task\n– ordering a coffee through their mobile app. Here’s how you can map out the\ndetailed user flow:\n\n1. **Opening the App**: The user launches the Starbucks app on their mobile\n   device.\n2. **Signing In**: The user logs in using their credentials. If they are already\n   logged in, this step is skipped.\n3. **Navigating to Order Menu**: The user selects the ‘Order’ option on the home\n   screen.\n4. **Selecting Store Location**: The app either automatically suggests nearby\n   stores based on the user’s location or prompts the user to choose a location.\n5. **Choosing the Beverage**: The user browses the menu and selects their\n   desired coffee. For example, they choose a ‘Caramel Macchiato.’\n6. **Customizing the Order**: The user customizes their drink – by selecting a\n   size, milk type, sugar level, etc.\n7. **Adding to Cart**: The user adds the coffee once satisfied with their\n   choices.\n8. **Reviewing the Order**: The user reviews their order for accuracy.\n9. **Payment**: The user chooses a payment method (credit card, Starbucks card,\n   or another payment service) and completes the transaction.\n10. **Order Confirmation**: The user receives a confirmation with an estimated\n    pick-up time.\n11. **Order Preparation and Pick-Up Notification**: The user is notified when\n    their order is ready for pick-up.\n12. **Pick-Up**: The user picks up their order at the selected store.\n\nThere are different stages in the ordering process, each of which can be a\nsource of satisfaction or frustration for the user. For instance, quick and easy\npayment processing and smooth navigation can be pleasing, while slow loading\ntimes, app crashes, or a complicated customization process can be frustrating.\nBy examining these stages in detail, Starbucks can enhance the user experience,\nsimplify the ordering process, and address any problems that may lead to\ndissatisfaction. This thorough user flow analysis is essential for the\ndevelopment team to make targeted enhancements and for the support team to be\naware of the common issues and inquiries from users.\n\n## 4. Map the Flow to the Sections of Your Product\n\nThe next phase involves connecting the dots between the user flow and your\nproduct. Each step in the user flow should be mapped to your product's specific\npart or feature. This exercise helps visualize how different components of your\nproduct work together to facilitate the user’s journey. It’s a step that can\nilluminate the interconnectedness of your product's features, helping you and\nothers understand how changes in one area might impact another. This mapping is\ninvaluable for product development marketing and sales teams, who must\nunderstand the product in-depth to effectively communicate its benefits to\npotential customers.\n\n![A team of professionals from various backgrounds engages in a collaborative design session, illustrating the importance of understanding diverse user perspectives in product development.](navigating-new-product-guide-team-members-2.webp)\n\n## 5. Write Down Which Teams Are Responsible for Each of the Sections\n\nUnderstanding the product is one thing, but understanding who is responsible for\nwhat is within the product is another. This step involves identifying the teams\nor individuals accountable for each part of the product. This knowledge is\ncrucial for seamless collaboration and communication within the organization.\nKnowing who to turn to for specific issues or enhancements can significantly\nspeed up response times and improve efficiency. It’s about building a roadmap of\nhuman resources within your product’s ecosystem.\n\n## 6. Repeat These Steps as Needed\n\nA product, as do its users, is never static; it evolves with time. Therefore,\nunderstanding your product and its users is not a one-off task but a continuous\none. Regularly revisiting and updating your understanding of the user tasks,\nflows, and product sections ensures that your knowledge remains relevant and\nup-to-date. This iterative approach keeps you in sync with the changing dynamics\nof your product and its ecosystem.\n\n## 7. Visualize Your Ecosystem Map\n\nFinally, visualizing your ecosystem map can be a game changer. A visual\nrepresentation using a tool like Figma can make the complexities of your product\nmore comprehensible. It provides a shared reference point for all team members,\nfostering a common understanding and language around the product. A well-crafted\nvisual map is not just an informational tool but a catalyst for team\ncollaboration and innovation.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, understanding a new product is akin to charting a course through\nunfamiliar waters. From identifying your audience to visualizing the product\necosystem, this strategic approach is about building a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the product and its users. Whether you're a seasoned\nprofessional or a newcomer, this guide is your compass to navigating the\nproduct's world effectively, ensuring you're equipped to make a meaningful\ncontribution and align your efforts with the larger goals of your team and\ncompany.

At early-stage companies, where every\nhire is a significant leap of faith, onboarding takes on even greater\nimportance. In this article, we'll explore how to create a unique and memorable\nonboarding experience for startup founders and their early-stage employees in\nsoftware-based companies.\n\n![A laptop screen displaying a virtual meeting with multiple participants, accompanied by a ceramic mug on a wooden table in the foreground, depicts the new normal of remote collaboration.](remote-onboarding.webp)\n\n## Personalized Welcome Packages:\n\n**Onboarding should be a unique experience demonstrating your commitment to your\nnew team members.** Consider investing in personalized welcome packages that go\nbeyond the basics.\n\nWhile you're likely already spending a substantial amount on equipment, these\npackages should include items that show you've thought about them specifically.\nThese items should also reflect and reinforce your company's mission, purpose,\nand values. For example, if your company values adventure and a can-do spirit,\nconsider including a mug that says, \"Adventure Begins.\" If mental well-being is\na priority, add a handwritten note welcoming them and instructions on redeeming\na year of a meditation app subscription.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the cost of these personalized items is minimal\ncompared to the potential benefits of higher employee morale, increased loyalty,\nand a deeper connection to your company's mission and values. It's about\ncreating a memorable and unique onboarding experience that leaves a lasting\npositive impression on your new team members, setting the tone for a successful\nand fulfilling journey together.\n\n## Focus on the Individual, Not Utility Items:\n\nWhile utility items like notebooks and pens are essential, they are better\nsuited for the equipment package rather than the welcome package. The welcome\npackage should be about the individual, making them feel special and\nappreciated.\n\n## Assign a Pal:\n\nGive your new hires a point of contact who isn't their direct supervisor—someone\nthey can turn to with questions and concerns. New hires often feel uncomfortable\nsharing their questions or thoughts in company-wide communication channels. This\nperson can help them navigate the company culture, protocols, and unwritten\nrules, fostering a sense of belonging.\n\n## Embrace Face-to-Face Communication:\n\nIn the early onboarding stages, it's crucial to actively encourage and\nfacilitate video calls within the first 48 hours. While asynchronous workflows\nhave their merits, even individuals who typically lean towards quick\nasynchronous chats, like myself, benefit significantly from being nudged towards\nvideo interactions at the outset. Textual communication, whether chat messages,\ncode reviews, or design feedback, often needs to be improved in conveying the\nnuances of one's mindset and emotions hidden behind the words on the screen.\n\n**By initiating these early video calls, you set the stage for building\nessential relational capital** and gaining a deeper understanding of each team\nmember's personality. This, in turn, enhances overall communication efficiency\nand reduces the need for second-guessing the emotional tone of messages. These\ninitial video calls can take various forms, such as pairing sessions for machine\nonboarding, quick company and team history walkthroughs, and discussions about\nteam dynamics. Importantly, these face-to-face interactions provide a platform\nwhere tone and intonation can be accurately perceived, fostering stronger\nconnections and smoother collaborations.\n\n## Set Clear Boundaries:\n\nEarly-stage startups often involve passionate, driven employees who might blur\nthe lines between work and personal life. It's crucial to set clear expectations\nfrom the start. Encourage employees to silence notifications at specific hours,\nexplain your company's approach to asynchronous communication, and clarify\nresponse expectations.\n\n## Streamlined Onboarding Process:\n\nThe onboarding experience sets the tone for a new employee's journey. While time\nis precious, dedicating half a day to craft a setup script that allows a new\nemployee to execute a single command can yield tremendous downstream benefits.\n\nA well-structured setup script accelerates the new employee's ability to get\nstarted and sets a precedent of efficiency and attention to detail within the\ncompany. **It sends a clear message that the organization values the time and\nexperience of its team members**, ultimately contributing to a positive and\nproductive work environment.\n\n## Mindful Slack Channel Management:\n\nWhile it may not be the most conventional advice, encouraging team members to\nmute as many Slack channels as possible is worth it. Even in smaller companies,\nthe sheer volume of messages can become overwhelming. Start by minimizing\nreal-time communication and prioritize recording essential information whenever\nit arises.\n\n## Enhance Home Office Setup:\n\nWhile most startups offer a home office stipend, go the extra mile by providing\na list of useful items that existing team members have found valuable in\nimproving their setups and processes. This proactive approach helps newcomers\nfeel supported and well-equipped.\n\n---\n\n**Remote onboarding for early-stage software startups is a unique opportunity to\nmake a lasting impression on new team members.** By personalizing welcome\npackages, fostering face-to-face communication, and setting clear boundaries,\nyou can create an onboarding experience that sets the right tone for your\ncompany's culture and values.

In this article,\nwe'll delve into how to **balance driving your startup forward and staying\nmindful of its objectives**. By doing so, you will be better equipped to achieve\nsuccess and propel your business to new heights.\n\n![Neon question mark glowing in a dark urban tunnel with graffiti-covered walls, symbolizing the search for answers and direction in the uncertain journey of startups.](measuring-progress-in-unpredictable-startups.webp)\n\n## The Move-Forward Mindset\n\nStartups need a progress-focused mindset to succeed, like rocket fuel,\npropelling them forward despite uncertainties in the early stages. It encourages\nexperimentation, innovation, and adaptability, essential for startups to survive\nin the competitive business world. Every day is important, and progress must\ncontinue. This environment pushes startups to make rapid iterations and pivots,\nwhich enables them to remain agile and make necessary adjustments to reach their\ngoals.\n\n## Challenges in Measuring Progress\n\nMeasuring progress can be tricky, especially at the early stages of a startup.\nIt is a crucial aspect of evaluating your journey but can also seem daunting due\nto the challenges involved. The end goal may need to be more explicit in many\nstartup scenarios. **Founders often struggle to define what \"success\" truly\nmeans for their venture, which can create ambiguity and lead to the assumption\nthat measuring progress is unattainable or counterproductive.** People do not\nnecessarily argue against measuring progress, but they may assume it's not a\nviable option due to the uncertainty surrounding their ultimate objectives. This\nambiguity can create hesitation and uncertainty in the early stages of a\nstartup.\n\n## Why Measuring Progress Matters\n\nHere's where the crux lies – even if the initial goal evolves or is proven\nincorrect, measuring progress is invaluable. It's not just about reaching the\ngoal; **it's about assessing how quickly you can determine the validity of that\ngoal.**\n\nConsider a case study to illustrate this point:\n\n## Case Study: Airbnb\n\n### Result:\n\nToday, Airbnb boasts millions of listings in over 220 countries and regions,\noffering diverse accommodations and experiences.\n\n### Key Takeaway:\n\nThe Airbnb case study demonstrates the importance of having a forward-thinking\nmindset in early-stage startups. Even though their initial goal was small, their\nability to measure progress, adapt to changing objectives, and pivot when\nnecessary played a crucial role in their transformation into a global leader in\nthe hospitality industry. This case study highlights how embracing change and\nmonitoring progress can lead to startup success.\n\nA forward-thinking attitude is vital in startups, but a commitment to measuring\nprogress must accompany it. Whether your startup's goals are well-defined or\nunclear, keeping track of your journey's speed and direction is essential.\n\nRemember that early-stage companies often need to determine whether their\noriginal goals are feasible before achieving them. **Measuring progress is not\nonly about reaching the destination but also about effectively navigating the\npath.**\n\nTherefore, adopt the startup mentality of moving forward while recognizing the\nimportance of knowing where you stand. It's the art of startup navigation – a\nblend of speed and vigilance that can lead to success in even the most\nchallenging terrains of entrepreneurship.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Airbnb Case Study:\n  https://medium.com/future-sensor/case-study-airbnb-7f4e2a66184c","src/content/blog/measuring-progress-in-unpredictable-startups.mdx","e6d59e91ba9cb84d","performance-budgets-guide",{"id":356,"data":358,"body":365,"filePath":366,"digest":367,"deferredRender":27},{"title":359,"date":360,"tags":361,"description":363,"image":364,"draft":22,"readingTime":149},"The Why, What, and How of Performance Budgets: Build Faster, Better Products",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.231Z"],[349,19,81,362,220,221,327,79],"pwa","Learn how performance budgets can transform your web or app experience.

Here’s\na closer look at strategies that let you have your cake (features) and eat it\ntoo (performance):\n\n### 1. Loading Strategies: Timing Is Everything\n\nNot everything on your site needs to load at the same time. Strategic loading\nensures users get what they need quickly without waiting for the kitchen sink to\narrive.\n\n- **Lazy Loading:** Only load non-critical resources (like below-the-fold images\n  or videos) when they’re needed. For instance, images further down the page\n  should load only as the user scrolls toward them. This saves bandwidth and\n  speeds up initial page rendering. However, be careful with crucial content\n  like hero images or key elements affecting Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). For\n  such elements, consider using **eager loading** (`loading=\"eager\"`) to ensure\n  they load immediately and enhance perceived performance without compromising\n  the user experience.\n- **Preloading:** Think of preloading as setting the table before dinner. Use it\n  for essential resources like fonts, hero images, or main CSS files so they’re\n  ready to display as soon as needed. A simple\n  `\u003Clink rel=\"preload\" as=\"image\" href=\"hero.jpg\">` can make a big difference.\n- **Prefetching:** This is your crystal ball for user behavior. If you know\n  users are likely to navigate to a certain page, prefetch the resources for\n  that page in advance. It’s like preparing a shortcut to the next room before\n  the user even steps through the first door.\n\n### 2. Resource Optimization: Cut the Fat\n\nBloated code and oversized resources slow everything down. Slimming them down is\nlike switching from a gas-guzzling SUV to a sleek electric car—better for\neveryone.\n\n- **Code Splitting:** Instead of serving all your JavaScript in one gigantic\n  file, break it into smaller chunks that load on demand. For example, load only\n  the code necessary for the current page or feature, leaving other chunks to\n  load later when needed. Popular frameworks like React and Vue support this\n  natively.\n- **Tree Shaking:** Why carry unused luggage? Tree shaking removes unused\n  JavaScript from your bundles, ensuring your app serves only the code it\n  actually uses. Tools like Webpack or Rollup are pros at this.\n- **Responsive Images:** Serve images optimized for different screen sizes using\n  the `\u003Cpicture>` element or `srcset`. Why serve a massive 4K image to someone\n  browsing on a smartphone? Responsive images deliver the perfect size for the\n  right device, saving bandwidth and improving load times.\n\n### 3. Reduce Blocking: Get Out of the User’s Way\n\nNothing kills the user experience like scripts or stylesheets that block page\nrendering. Minimizing these interruptions ensures a smoother and faster\nexperience.\n\n- **Critical CSS:** Extract and inline only the CSS necessary to render\n  above-the-fold content, while deferring non-critical styles to load later.\n  This ensures users see something useful as quickly as possible.\n- **Service Workers:** Cache assets locally in the user’s browser with service\n  workers. This not only reduces load times on repeat visits but also makes your\n  app feel lightning-fast when offline or on slow networks.\n\n### 4. Network Upgrades: Faster Delivery, Everywhere\n\nEven the most optimized resources need a fast highway to travel on. Upgrading\nyour network protocols and delivery methods ensures your assets get to users\nquickly and efficiently.\n\n- **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:** These modern protocols allow browsers to fetch multiple\n  resources in parallel, reducing wait times caused by older HTTP bottlenecks.\n  HTTP/3, powered by the QUIC protocol, is particularly beneficial in scenarios\n  with high packet loss, such as mobile networks or public Wi-Fi. It also\n  improves connection times for users in distant regions by eliminating multiple\n  round trips during handshake processes, making it ideal for global audiences.\n- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Think of a CDN as a network of express\n  delivery hubs. By serving resources from servers geographically closer to\n  users, a CDN reduces latency and ensures snappy load times. Bonus: CDNs also\n  handle high traffic volumes like a champ.\n\n### 5. Progressive Rendering: Perception Is Reality\n\nSometimes, speeding up perceived load times is just as important as improving\nactual load times. Progressive rendering techniques give users something to\ninteract with sooner, even if the rest of the page is still loading.\n\n- **Skeleton Screens:** Replace blank spaces with lightweight placeholders (like\n  a grayed-out version of the UI) while the real content loads. This reassures\n  users that progress is happening and keeps them engaged.\n- **Progressive Images:** Start with a low-resolution placeholder, such as a\n  blurred or SVG version of the image, and swap it out for the high-resolution\n  version once it’s ready. Tools like [BlurHash](https://blurha.sh/) make this a\n  breeze.\n\n## Wrapping It Up\n\nPerformance budgets aren’t just about hitting metrics—they’re about creating\nwebsites and apps that users love and trust. By defining clear benchmarks,\noptimizing intelligently, and tracking results, you’re setting your product up\nfor long-term success. Start small: **pick a key metric, implement a budget, and\niterate**. With the right tools and strategies, you can deliver exceptional\nexperiences that drive engagement and boost your bottom line.

The team identified three systemic issues and brainstormed five concrete improvements. Everyone nods enthusiastically about the action items. Three months later, the same incident happens again, and you realize none of the fixes were actually implemented.\n\nThis execution gap is where most post-mortem programs fail. Even when teams identify valuable insights and concrete improvements, follow-through often falters. Without clear ownership and systematic tracking, action items disappear into backlogs, and the underlying vulnerabilities remain.\n\nThe brutal reality: Less than 50% of organizations have mature incident learning processes with consistent follow-through. Those that do enjoy substantially fewer repeat outages.[²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-2) The completion gap is what separates incremental learning from real resilience.\n\n![A ranger's checklist at a trailhead.](incident-dive4-rangers-checklist.webp)\n\n## Why Action Items Die\n\nUnderstanding why follow-ups fail is crucial to fixing the process:\n\n### The Action Item Void\n\nAtlassian calls this the \"action item void\": the black hole where good intentions go to die. Google's SRE documentation describes it as creating \"unvirtuous cycles of unclosed postmortems\" when organizations reward writing reports but not completing the associated fixes.[¹¹](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-11)\n\nThis execution gap is widely recognized across the industry. **Subpar postmortems with incomplete action items make incident recurrence far more likely**, and action items without clear owners are significantly less likely to be resolved.[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10)\n\n### Two Fatal Patterns\n\n#### Vague Ownership\nActions like \"investigate X\" or \"add monitoring for Y\" get assigned to a team or left unassigned. When everyone owns it, no one owns it. Without a single accountable person, the task never happens.\n\n#### No Deadlines or Follow-up\nIn many organizations, there's no defined timeline for post-mortem fixes. Teams move on to new project work, and incident action items get deprioritized indefinitely. One report notes that teams had to implement strict 4- or 8-week SLOs for completing \"priority actions\" to ensure these fixes weren't endlessly postponed.[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10)\n\n### The Vicious Cycle\n\nThe result is predictable: the same incident (or a closely related one) will recur because the underlying vulnerability remains. Meanwhile, leadership has a false sense of security because there's a nice post-mortem document filed away.\n\nThis is perhaps the biggest failure mode in post-incident programs.\n\n## How Leading Teams Ensure Follow-Through\n\nElite organizations have cracked the code on action accountability through systematic approaches:\n\n### Assign Clear Ownership\n\nEvery single action item from a post-mortem gets assigned to an individual owner (with their agreement), not to a group or left as \"TBD.\" That person is accountable for driving completion or escalating issues.\n\nAtlassian's approach: They track all post-mortem follow-up tasks in Jira, linking them to the incident ticket, with an assignee for each.[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10) This avoids the diffusion of responsibility that plagues many follow-ups.\n\nWhy individuals matter: Personal accountability creates ownership. When someone's name is on a task, they're more likely to drive it to completion or raise blockers early.\n\n### Set Realistic Deadlines and SLOs\n\nNot all fixes are equal. Some might be quick (adding a missing alert), others might require multi-sprint projects (re-architecting part of a system). Set target deadlines appropriate to the size and priority:\n\n- **Small fixes:** 2-week deadlines\n- **Medium improvements:** 4-8 weeks with milestones\n- **Large projects:** Break into phases with concrete deliverables\n\nAtlassian's framework: They designate \"Priority 1 actions\" that must be completed within 4 or 8 weeks depending on severity, with actual reporting on these deadlines.[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10)\n\nThe goal isn't micro-management but ensuring improvements don't slip into \"someday.\" If an action will take longer than a couple of months, break it into phases or make it a formal project.\n\n### Build Tracking and Reminder Systems\n\nWhat mechanism ensures the team doesn't forget? This can be lightweight but must be consistent:\n\n#### Monthly Review Cadence\nSome teams set up an \"Incident Action Item Kanban\" visible to engineering leads and review it in staff meetings every two weeks. This creates gentle peer pressure to complete tasks and allows raising blockers.\n\n#### Automated Reminders\nMany companies automate periodic Slack reminders about open post-mortem tasks. Atlassian built custom reporting from Jira to see how many incidents still have open \"priority actions,\" with managers reviewing that list regularly.[¹¹](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-11)\n\n#### Executive Visibility\n**Measure it and it will improve.** If leadership tracks \"action item closure rate\" as a key metric, teams are more likely to follow through. High-performing teams treat that closure rate as seriously as uptime or velocity.\n\n### Secure Executive Buy-In\n\nThis is a force multiplier. When senior leaders (director, VP, CTO) regularly read post-mortems and ask about follow-up status, it signals this work is truly important.\n\nGoogle's approach: SRE leaders note that management's active participation in postmortem reviews and follow-up is crucial to reinforce the culture.[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5) In practice, this might mean:\n- A senior leader chairs post-mortem reviews for major incidents\n- Executives add comments like \"The database timeout fix looks critical. Do you need help getting database team bandwidth?\"\n- Public recognition for team members who implement major preventive fixes\n\n**When the top sets the tone that reliability improvements are first-class work (not \"maintenance chores\"), engineers make time for it.**\n\n### Keep Actions Concrete and Achievable\n\nEnsure actions are specific and within the team's scope. Avoid vague suggestions or aspirational goals that everyone knows won't happen.\n\n- **Instead of:** \"Consider doing X\" or \"100% test coverage\"\n- **Use:** \"Evaluate X tool and present findings by [date]\" or \"Add tests for modules A, B (which caused this outage)\"\n\nThis makes accountability clear. If something is truly a nice-to-have that likely won't get resources, don't list it: or put it in a separate \"future ideas\" section.\n\n## The Systematic Approach\n\nHere's how to build action accountability into your process:\n\n### During the Post-Mortem Meeting\n\n1. **Brainstorm improvements** for each root cause identified\n2. **Prioritize ruthlessly** using impact vs. effort or risk reduction potential\n3. **Assign owners** for each action item during the meeting\n4. **Set deadlines** based on scope and priority\n5. **Document everything** in your tracking system before the meeting ends\n\n### After the Meeting\n\n1. **Create tracking tickets** in your project management system\n2. **Set calendar reminders** for deadline check-ins\n3. **Add to team dashboards** so progress is visible\n4. **Schedule follow-up meetings** if needed for complex items\n\n### Monthly Reviews\n\n1. **Review all open items** with engineering leadership\n2. **Identify blockers** and escalate if needed\n3. **Celebrate completions** and their impact\n4. **Adjust processes** based on what's working/not working\n\n## Measuring Success\n\nTrack these metrics to ensure your accountability system works:\n\n### Completion Metrics\n- **Action item closure rate** (aim for >80% within SLO)\n- **Average time to completion** (trending downward)\n- **Percentage of overdue items** (minimize this)\n\n### Outcome Metrics\n- **Repeat incident rate** (should decrease as fixes accumulate)\n- **Time to resolution** (should improve as systems get more robust)\n- **Team satisfaction** with the follow-up process\n\n## Common Accountability Failures\n\n### The \"Everything is High Priority\" Trap\nIf every action item is marked urgent, nothing gets the attention it deserves. Use a clear prioritization framework and accept that some improvements will wait.\n\n### The \"We'll Get to It Next Sprint\" Syndrome\nWithout explicit deadlines and tracking, \"next sprint\" becomes \"never.\" Build accountability into your existing sprint planning process.\n\n### The \"Perfect Solution\" Paralysis\nDon't let the pursuit of perfect fixes prevent good incremental improvements. A quick monitoring alert is better than no alert while you design the perfect observability strategy.\n\n## Business Impact of Strong Accountability\n\nOrganizations with systematic action item tracking and completion see:\n\n- **Significantly fewer repeat incidents** compared to teams with poor follow-through[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10).\n- **Accumulated institutional knowledge** and resilience over time.\n- **Higher team morale** as engineers see their effort resulting in tangible improvements.\n- **Customer trust** through demonstrated commitment to reliability.\n\nAs Google acknowledges, continuous postmortem investment results in fewer outages over time and better user experiences.[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5) **Robust action follow-through pays off in reliability and customer trust.**\n\n## Process Guardrails\n\n- **85% closure target:** Maintain >85% action item completion rate with clear owners and deadlines\n- **Individual ownership:** Every action gets assigned to a specific person, never a team or \"TBD\"\n- **Weekly tracking:** Review open action items in staff meetings with visible progress updates\n\n## Implementation Quick Start\n\n1. **Add ownership and deadlines** to your current [post-mortem template](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Incident-Postmortem-Template-Blameless-26e6edefd08e80c6829bfffe0e2293fe).\n2. **Create a simple tracking dashboard** (even a shared spreadsheet works initially).\n3. **Set monthly review cadence** with engineering leadership.\n4. **Celebrate early wins** when action items prevent future incidents.\n5. **Iterate and improve** the process based on team feedback.\n\n### Continue the series:\n\n- [Four-Phase Implementation Playbook](/articles/post-mortem-implementation-playbook) - A structured rollout approach\n- [Convincing Skeptical Leaders](/articles/post-mortem-leadership-buy-in) - Getting executive support for the investment\n\n---\n\n> **Want the definitive framework?** Read the [Definitive Guide](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide) for detailed tracking templates, success metrics, and case studies from Google, Atlassian, and other leading organizations.\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- Definitive Guide (60 min) – canonical reference\n  - https://www.benjamincharity.com/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide","src/content/blog/post-mortem-action-accountability.mdx","bb289bba8c5ddbcd","post-mortem-definitive-guide",{"id":382,"data":384,"body":391,"filePath":392,"digest":393,"deferredRender":27},{"title":385,"date":386,"tags":387,"description":388,"image":389,"draft":22,"readingTime":390},"Effective Post-Mortems: The Definitive Guide",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.232Z"],[244,17,18,93,233],"The complete, data-informed framework for blameless post-mortems that prevent repeat incidents, with free Notion templates.","only-you-can-prevent-incidents.webp",61,"80% of major incidents are self-inflicted[^1]. 69% go unnoticed until users are already impacted[^1]. And yet most post-mortems end in finger-pointing and action items that never get done.\n\nThe best engineering organizations treat incidents differently. They use them as raw material for building more resilient systems. This guide shows you the data-driven framework that transforms post-mortems from blame theater into systematic improvement engines.\n\n> **Short on time?** Read the [Executive Brief](/articles/post-mortem-executive-brief) (7 min) or the [Field Guide](/articles/post-mortem-field-guide) (20 min).\n\n![Grizzled ranger bear beside spoofed park sign: \"ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT INCIDENTS.\"](only-you-can-prevent-incidents.webp)\n\n## The Reality Check\n\nA director explained the same database timeout issue for the third time in six months. Each incident write-up blamed a different team member, but the root cause never changed. No systemic fixes followed, so the outages kept happening. This isn't a rare story; it's common when post-mortems are treated as a formality or finger-pointing exercise.\n\nThe brutal data: An empirical study of 26 major fintech incidents found **80% of incidents stemmed from internal changes** (deployments, config updates) that weren't tested or controlled properly[^1]. Additionally, **69% of incidents lacked proactive alerts**, meaning teams only discovered the problem after damage was done[^1]. In other words, the majority of outages are self-inflicted and caught too late. And while most organizations do create post-mortem reports after big incidents, many skip the hard work of systemic change. The result: the same failures repeat. Industry experts note that despite formal incident processes, recurring IT incidents persist; this indicates that teams aren't truly learning or improving systems[^1].\n\nThe gap between average and elite teams is enormous. High-performing orgs virtually eliminate repeat failures: in top \"Site Reliability Engineering\" cultures, major incidents rarely recur. One report notes that companies with a continuous learning culture (blameless post-mortems, proactive fixes) experience far fewer customer-impacting incidents than their peers[^2]. **Elite teams prevent ~95% of repeat incidents**, whereas average teams get stuck in a costly blame-fix-repeat cycle. From a director's lens, this is the reality check: unless we overhaul how we approach post-incident reviews, we'll keep firefighting the same fires over and over.\n\n## Why Smart Teams Keep Making Dumb Mistakes\n\nEven very smart and capable teams fall into subtle traps that render their post-mortems ineffective. I've seen this pattern repeatedly across engineering teams: they dutifully write detailed post-mortems after each outage, then file them away. Nothing changes. The same deployment misconfigurations bite them sprint after sprint. Why does this happen? Here are the three silent killers:\n\n### Silent Killer 1: Lack of Psychological Safety (Warfare, Not Safety)\n\nWhen engineers fear blame, the whole post-mortem process becomes a superficial exercise. Google's famous \"Project Aristotle\" research found that **psychological safety was the #1 predictor of team performance**, even more important than technical expertise[^3]. Psychological safety means team members feel safe admitting mistakes or saying \"I don't know.\" Without it, incidents turn into information warfare: people hide or downplay crucial facts to avoid embarrassment. During outages, this is disastrous; if folks hesitate to speak up about a misstep, recovery is delayed and root causes stay hidden.\n\nIn high-safety teams, members report significantly more errors. Not because they make more mistakes, but because they feel safe admitting them. Amy Edmondson's classic 1999 study in healthcare teams first demonstrated this effect, and more recent reviews confirm it(people in psychologically safe environments consistently report higher error rates, reflecting openness rather than poor performance[^4]. A safe environment surfaces problems early, while blame-driven cultures drive them underground. Google's \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr> guide bluntly warns)**\"An atmosphere of blame risks creating a culture in which incidents and issues are swept under the rug\"**, increasing risk to the organization[^5]. In short, when post-mortems feel like witch hunts, you get cover-ups instead of lessons learned.\n\n> **Leadership insight:** A \u003Cabbr title=\"Chief Technology Officer\">CTO\u003C/abbr> or director might worry that \"blameless\" post-mortems let people off the hook. In practice, the opposite is true: removing fear increases accountability and information sharing. Teams like Etsy have demonstrated this by encouraging engineers to openly email the whole company about mistakes they made, with no punishment, resulting in a self-perpetuating learning culture[^6]. Blameless does not mean consequences never happen; it means the focus is on fixing the system, not shaming the individual. As Dave Zwieback (former Head of Engineering at Next Big Sound) put it, blame is \"convenient\" but it short-circuits learning[^7]. High-performing teams prioritize truth over blame.\n\n### Silent Killer 2: Cognitive Biases and Hindsight Blind Spots\n\nAfter an incident, it's human nature to ask \"who missed the warning signs?\" and \"how did we not see this coming?\", falling victim to hindsight bias. Hindsight bias makes past events seem obvious, leading us to conclude we \"should have known\" things that were actually unknowable before. Similarly, outcome bias causes us to judge decisions purely by their outcome. For example, if a deployment succeeded we call it \"a good plan,\" but if an identical approach led to an outage we call it \"obviously foolish\", even if the team's decision process was the same in both cases.\n\nThese biases infect even veteran incident investigators. Studies in safety science show that even experienced investigators can be led astray by their own preconceived theories; they seek evidence to fit a favorite hypothesis and overlook contrary facts[^8]. In practice, this means a post-mortem might pin the cause on an easy scapegoat (\"human error\" or one misconfigured setting) when in reality there were multiple contributing factors. Zwieback points out that **hindsight and blame create a \"comfortable story\" that satisfies our need for closure but prevents real learning**[^7]. We prematurely decide \"Ah, Susan deployed bad code, that's the root cause,\" and stop analyzing deeper systemic issues. The post-mortem ends with shallow conclusions and vague \"be more careful\" action items. The true contributing causes: design flaws, insufficient tests, ambiguous runbooks, etc. remain unaddressed.\n\nA 2023 empirical examination using construction case studies found that incident investigators often fall prey to confirmation bias, anchoring bias, and the fundamental attribution error when collecting interview information[^9]. In practice, this means investigators may latch onto an early hypothesis, prioritize questions that fit their assumptions, or attribute failure to a person's character without considering the contextual pressures that made the failure possible. To counteract this, post-mortems need structured protocols: include multiple perspectives, document alternative hypotheses, and ask \"What conditions enabled this mistake?\" instead of \"Who screwed up?\"\n\n### Silent Killer 3: The Action-Item \"Death Spiral\"\n\nFinally, even when a post-mortem identifies valuable fixes, execution is where many teams stumble. Without clear ownership and deadlines, follow-ups tend to languish in backlogs until they're forgotten. Atlassian calls this the \"action item void\"[^10] while Google SRE documentation describes it as creating \"unvirtuous cycles of unclosed postmortems\" when organizations reward writing postmortems but not completing the associated action items[^11]. This execution gap is widely recognized: Atlassian notes that **subpar postmortems with incomplete action items make incident recurrence far more likely**, and action items without clear owners are significantly less likely to be resolved[^10]. Organizations that establish clear ownership, deadlines, and tracking systems see dramatically better follow-through on preventive fixes. This completion gap is what separates incremental learning from real resilience.\n\nWhy do action items fall through the cracks? Two patterns stand out:\n\n- **Vague ownership:** Actions like \"investigate X\" or \"add monitoring for Y\" get assigned to a team or left unassigned. When everyone owns it, no one owns it. Without a single accountable owner, the task never happens.\n- **No deadlines or follow-up:** In many orgs, there's no defined timeline for post-mortem fixes. Teams move on to new project work; the incident action items get deprioritized indefinitely. One report by Atlassian notes that they had to implement strict 4- or 8-week \u003Cabbr title=\"Service Level Objectives\">SLOs\u003C/abbr> for completing \"priority actions\" and managerial approval to ensure these fixes weren't endlessly postponed[^10].\n\nThe result of inaction is predictable: the same incident (or a closely related one) will recur because the underlying vulnerability remains. It's a vicious cycle; a big incident happens, everyone scrambles and writes up lessons, but no one makes time to implement the fixes, so the incident happens again. Meanwhile, leadership has a false sense of security because there's a nice post-mortem document filed away. **This is perhaps the biggest failure mode in post-incident programs.**\n\nOn average, less than 50% of organizations have a mature, proactive incident learning process (e.g. blameless reviews with follow-through); those that do enjoy substantially fewer repeat outages[^2]. The rest remain reactive. As an engineering leader, it's worth asking: Do we track our post-mortem action item completion rate? If the answer is \"no\" or the rate is low, that's a red flag that your post-mortems might be \"performance theater\" rather than catalysts for improvement.\n\n> **Leadership pushback:** A common objection from management is \"we have too many action items and not enough time; we can't do all these.\" The reality is you can't afford not to. Unfixed failures will bite again; often at the worst time. It's about prioritizing: identify the high-severity, high-frequency problems (use a risk matrix like Severity × Occurrence × Detection[^19]) and tackle those first. Also, involve senior leadership in this process. Atlassian notes that effective post-mortem processes require commitment at all levels in the organization[^10]. Research shows that organizations implementing changes after past incidents reduce future incident rates by 50%[^12]. And remember, the cost of not fixing issues is downtime. Gartner estimates downtime costs ~$5,600 per minute on average[^13]; even a single repeat outage can far outweigh the engineering effort needed to prevent it.\n\n## The Framework That Actually Works\n\nThe good news? This destructive cycle isn't inevitable. Leading organizations have cracked the code on turning post-mortems from blame sessions into genuine learning engines. They've discovered that **three fundamental shifts in approach can transform an entire organization's relationship with failure**. The results speak for themselves: companies implementing systematic post-incident improvements see up to 50% fewer repeat incidents[^12], faster recovery times, and engineering teams that actually trust the process.\n\nThese transformations rest on [three pillars](#pillar-1-psychological-safety-infrastructure):\n\n### Pillar 1: Psychological Safety Infrastructure\n\nThis pillar is all about baking blamelessness into the process by design. It's not enough to tell people \"please be honest\"; you need structural and cultural practices that reinforce a safe environment.\n\n#### Design blamelessness into the process\n\nThe post-mortem process and report should focus on what went wrong in the system, not who to blame. For example, avoid language like \"Engineer X didn't follow procedure\" and instead phrase it as \"The procedure was unclear, and safeguards failed to catch the issue.\" Google's \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr> guide explicitly notes that removing blame encourages people to escalate issues quickly and avoids a culture of hiding incidents[^5]. It also warns against stigmatizing those who contribute multiple postmortems; you don't want engineers thinking they'll look bad if they're associated with an incident[^5]. Make it clear at the outset: the goal is learning and fixing, not finger-pointing.\n\n#### Learn from Etsy's transparency model\n\nEtsy famously implemented a \"Just Culture\" where engineers publicly share their mistakes in company-wide emails so everyone can learn[^6]. These \"\u003Cabbr title=\"Public Service Announcement\">PSA\u003C/abbr>\" emails describe what happened, why the engineer made the choices they did, and what they learned, all without punishment. The \u003Cabbr title=\"Chief Executive Officer\">CEO\u003C/abbr> and \u003Cabbr title=\"Chief Technology Officer\">CTO\u003C/abbr> openly endorse this. The result? A highly proactive culture where people aren't afraid to surface problems. As Etsy's \u003Cabbr title=\"Chief Technology Officer\">CTO\u003C/abbr> John Allspaw put it, a funny thing happens when engineers feel safe to give details about mistakes, they actually become more accountable and the whole company gets better[^6]. We may not all choose the email route, but we can emulate the principle by encouraging open forums or Slack channels for sharing post-mortem insights across teams.\n\n#### Track psychological safety over time\n\nIt can help to measure this cultural aspect. Consider adding a quick survey after post-mortems (or periodic team health surveys) with Edmondson's questions like \"When someone makes a mistake on this team, it is not held against them.\" Track and aim to improve these scores over time. High reporting of mistakes is actually a positive indicator[^4], as long as we learn from them.\n\n#### Establish ground rules before incidents happen\n\nSet the expectation of blamelessness before the next outage. For instance, define a policy approved by leadership that any incident review will focus on what any reasonable person could learn from the situation, not on criticizing individuals. Make it part of engineer onboarding. When an incident occurs, remind everyone (in the Slack war room, etc.): \"This is a blameless investigation, all facts are welcome. No finger-pointing.\" This needs continual reinforcement, especially if the organization's past culture was punitive.\n\n#### Why psychological safety drives results\n\nPsychological safety isn't just feel-good fluff; it's been linked to better reliability outcomes. **Teams with a blameless culture suffer fewer outages and deliver a better user experience, according to Google's internal data[^5]**. When people freely share information and concerns, incidents are resolved faster and future risks are caught earlier. Conversely, fear and blame create information silos that let small problems fester into big ones. [Pillar 1](#pillar-1-psychological-safety-infrastructure) lays the cultural foundation so that [Pillar 2](#pillar-2-systems-thinking-over-person-hunting) and [3](#pillar-3-action-accountability-that-sticks) (analysis and action) can actually be effective.\n\n### Pillar 2: Systems Thinking Over Person-Hunting\n\nThe second pillar is a mindset shift: focus on the system of factors that led to the incident, rather than hunting for the single \"culprit.\" This comes from the field of safety science and complex systems theory. In complex systems (like our production environments), **failures are almost never due to one person or one glitch in isolation; they result from multiple contributing factors lining up**. As the old saying goes, \"major incidents are like Swiss cheese; several holes had to align.\"\n\n#### Shift from \"who\" to \"how\" questions\n\nIn post-mortem discussions, deliberately shift the language from \"Who did X?\" to \"How did our system allow X to happen?\" and \"What conditions contributed to Y?\". For example, instead of \"Why did Bob deploy a bug on Friday?\", ask \"What testing or review process failed such that a bug made it to production on Friday? What pressures or assumptions led Bob to think it was okay?\" By examining the system (tools, processes, team norms, timeline, etc.), you reveal deeper fixes. This echoes practices in aviation and healthcare where they adopted \"just culture\" investigations: they ask how the system failed, not which individual to punish[^22].\n\n#### Apply structured analysis frameworks\n\nTechniques like the \"5 Whys\"[^14] (with a twist (asking \"Why did the system allow this?\" each time) or Fishbone diagrams[^15] can help map out contributing causes across categories (human, process, technology, external). Also consider human factors insights(was the on-call engineer fatigued? Was documentation misleading? Was monitoring incomplete? These are systemic issues. As Dave Zwieback puts it)**\"Human error is a symptom, never the cause, of deeper trouble in the system.\"[^7]**. If someone made a mistake, ask what made that mistake possible and how the system could be made more robust to catch or prevent it.\n\n#### What the research tells us\n\nPioneers like Richard Cook (\"How Complex Systems Fail\") and Sidney Dekker have found that big failures normally require multiple things going wrong[^16]. Post-mortems should reflect this reality. In fact, a blameless analysis often uncovers 3-4 contributing factors. For example, an outage might stem from a code bug **and** a missing alert **and** a slow rollback procedure **and** an unclear documentation of a feature flag; together these caused the impact. If we only blame the engineer, we miss the other three.\n\n#### Learn from aviation's transformation\n\nThe aviation industry achieved a 95%+ incident reporting rate and dramatically reduced accidents by adopting a systemic, non-blame approach. Through programs like NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System, pilots are given immunity when they voluntarily report errors or near-misses. This led to an enormous database of systemic issues and fixes. The result is that aviation's fatal accident rate kept dropping despite increasing complexity. The key takeaway for us: **when people aren't punished for mistakes, they report problems freely** (nearly all incidents get reported[^7]), and the organization as a whole gets safer. We should strive for a culture where engineers log near-misses and small incidents in our tracking systems without fear; those are free lessons to prevent the next big outage.\n\n> **Practical tip:** In your post-mortem template, include a section explicitly for \"Contributing Factors\" or \"Systemic Causes\" (plural). This sets the expectation that there's more than one cause. Also include \"What went well\"; to reinforce that incidents are learning opportunities, not purely negative blame events.\n\nBy treating incidents as signals of systemic weaknesses, you fix problems at the root. You also avoid morale-killing blame games that drive talent away. **People are more willing to confess \"I pushed a bad config\" if they know the outcome will be \"let's improve the config validation and training\" instead of \"you're written up for messing up.\"** Over time, this creates a virtuous cycle: engineers trust the process, share more info, and the fixes make the system stronger (what some call an antifragile system; it learns and improves under stress). Companies like Netflix have even embraced chaos engineering (intentionally causing minor failures) to continually harden their systems and find weaknesses before they become incidents[^17].\n\n### Pillar 3: Action Accountability That Sticks\n\nThe third pillar addresses the execution gap: ensuring the improvements identified actually get done and stay done. This is where many teams falter. Leading teams adopt practices that dramatically increase their action item completion rate:\n\n#### Assign clear ownership\n\nEvery single action item from a post-mortem is assigned to an individual owner (with their agreement), not to a group or left as \"TBD.\" Tools like Linear or ClickUp can be used to track these, but the key is someone's name is on it. Atlassian, for example, tracks all post-mortem follow-up tasks in Jira and links them to the incident ticket, with an assignee for each[^10]. That person is accountable for driving it to completion or escalating issues with it. This avoids the diffusion of responsibility that plagues many follow-ups.\n\n#### Set realistic deadlines and \u003Cabbr title=\"Service Level Objectives\">SLOs\u003C/abbr>\n\nNot all fixes are equal (some might be quick to add a missing alert, others might require a multi-sprint project (re-architecting part of a system). Set a target deadline or Service Level Objective for each action, appropriate to its size and priority. In effective teams, small fixes typically get a 2-week deadline; bigger items might get 4-8 weeks with milestones. The Atlassian incident program does something similar: they designate \"Priority 1 actions\" that must be completed within 4 or 8 weeks depending on severity, and they actually report on these deadlines[^10]. **The goal isn't to micro-manage, but to ensure improvements don't slip into \"someday.\"** If an action will take longer than a couple of months, that's fine; but then break it into phases or make it a formal project so it doesn't vanish.\n\n#### Build tracking and reminder systems\n\nWhat mechanism ensures the team doesn't forget? This can be lightweight. Some teams set up an \"Incident Action Item Kanban\" visible to engineering leads, and review it in their staff meeting every two weeks. Many companies automate reminders (e.g., PagerDuty's process sends periodic Slack reminders about open post-mortem tasks. Atlassian built custom reporting from Jira to see how many incidents still have open \"priority actions,\" and managers review that list regularly[^11]. The principle is: measure it and it will improve. If leadership tracks \"action item closure rate\" as a key metric, teams are more likely to follow through. High-performing teams treat that closure rate as seriously as uptime or velocity. Consistent tracking and follow-through on post-mortem actions correlates with very low repeat incident rates.\n\n#### Secure executive buy-in\n\nThis is a force multiplier. When senior leaders (director, \u003Cabbr title=\"Vice President\">VP\u003C/abbr>, \u003Cabbr title=\"Chief Technology Officer\">CTO\u003C/abbr>) regularly read post-mortems and ask about the status of follow-up actions, it sends a message that this work is truly important (not just lip service). Google \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr> leaders note that management's active participation in postmortem reviews and follow-up is crucial to reinforce the culture. In practice, this could mean a senior leader chairs the post-mortem review meeting for major incidents, or at least reviews the report and adds comments like _\"The database timeout fix looks critical. Do you need help getting database team bandwidth for this?\"_ Organizations where execs publicly recognize team members who implement major preventive fixes, similar to Google's peer bonuses for incident prevention work[^5], see higher completion rates. **When the top sets the tone that reliability improvements are first-class work, not \"maintenance chores,\" engineers make time for it.**\n\n#### Keep actions concrete and achievable\n\nEnsure actions are concrete and within the team's scope. Avoid vague suggestions like \"Consider doing X\" or aspirational goals like \"100% test coverage\" that everyone knows won't literally happen. Instead, break it down: e.g. _\"Evaluate X tool and present findings by date,\"_ or _\"Add tests for modules A, B (which caused this outage).\"_ This makes accountability clear. If something is truly a nice-to-have that likely won't get resources, it's better not to list it at all (or put it in a separate \"future ideas\" section). The action list should be a realistic commitment list.\n\nWhen actions are completed consistently, you learn that post-mortems lead to real change, not just documents. This builds a virtuous cycle of trust in the process. Teams that institutionalize this pillar have dramatically fewer repeat incidents. Organizations with systematic action item tracking and completion see significantly fewer repeat incidents, whereas teams with poor follow-through experience many repeats. Also, accountability prevents the \"post-mortem fatigue\" engineers feel when they write up a report and nothing improves. Instead, **engineers see their effort resulting in tangible system hardening, which motivates them to take the process seriously.** Over time, you accumulate institutional knowledge and resilience. Google acknowledges that their continuous postmortem investment resulted in fewer outages over time and better user experiences[^5]; **essentially, robust action follow-through pays off in reliability and customer trust.**\n\nBy integrating [Pillar 1](#pillar-1-psychological-safety-infrastructure) (Safety), [Pillar 2](#pillar-2-systems-thinking-over-person-hunting) (Systems thinking), and [Pillar 3](#pillar-3-action-accountability-that-sticks) (Accountability), you create a self-reinforcing loop: people freely divulge issues, you find true systemic causes, and you actually fix them. That's the loop that prevents future incidents.\n\n## The Four-Phase Implementation Playbook\n\nImproving your post-mortem process doesn't happen overnight. It helps to break it into phases. Here's a proven [four-phase playbook](#phase-1-immediate-response-0-48-hours-after-incident---stabilize-and-record) I recommend, which spans from the immediate incident response through ongoing learning:\n\n> **Quick Reference:** Bookmark this [Post-Mortem Cheat Sheet](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Post-Mortem-Cheat-Sheet-27b6edefd08e807ab127d93c09411e63) for facilitating your first post-mortems.\n\n### Phase 1: Immediate Response (0-48 hours after incident) - Stabilize and record\n\n- **Speed matters:** Elite \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr> teams mobilize response within minutes. Aim to have your on-call engineer respond and assemble a response team within 5 minutes. This quick engagement can cut downtime significantly. (By contrast, teams who wait 30+ minutes to respond invariably suffer longer \u003Cabbr title=\"Mean Time To Recovery\">MTTR\u003C/abbr>.) One key is to have clear on-call rotations and an incident commander role defined in advance.\n\n- **Communication cadence:** During the incident, establish a rhythm for updates; e.g., a public Slack channel or bridge line where someone posts an update every 15-20 minutes, even if it's \"investigating still.\" This keeps everyone aligned and avoids confusion, and it creates a timeline you can later use in the post-mortem. As PagerDuty notes, building a communication strategy to update stakeholders enables on-call responders to spend more time resolving the incident[^2].\n\n- **Real-time logging:** As the incident unfolds, encourage responders to jot down key events and decisions (time, action, outcome); either in a shared doc or directly in Slack. This becomes the raw timeline for the post-mortem. Capture events without blame language. For example, write \"18:42 - Deployment of version 1.2 initiated\" rather than \"Dev deployed bad code at 18:42.\" **Facts first, analysis later.** Google's postmortem guide emphasizes factual timelines to anchor the investigation[^18].\n\n- **48-hour rule for draft:** While the incident is fresh, get a draft post-mortem started within 48 hours. It need not be final, but document the basics(timeline, impact, known contributing factors, initial thoughts on cause. Google and other best-in-class orgs often publish postmortems within 24-48 hours of an outage[^18]. Fresh information is more accurate, and faster public postmortems also reassure stakeholders that you're addressing the issue[^18]. A senior engineer at Google put it)the longer you wait, the more people fill the void with speculation, which \"seldom works in your favor\"[^18]. So, [Phase 1](#phase-1-immediate-response-0-48-hours-after-incident---stabilize-and-record) ends with an initial post-mortem draft by day 2.\n\n### Phase 2: Deep Analysis (48 hours - 7 days) - Investigate thoroughly and find root causes\n\nOnce the fire is out and a preliminary doc exists, invest time in a deeper analysis before finalizing the report:\n\n- **Multidisciplinary review:** Gather people from all relevant areas for a post-mortem meeting (within a week). Include not just the directly involved engineers, but maybe \u003Cabbr title=\"Quality Assurance\">QA\u003C/abbr>, support, or others who have insight. Different perspectives ensure nothing is missed. For instance, Ops might point out monitoring gaps, \u003Cabbr title=\"Quality Assurance\">QA\u003C/abbr> might note a test case that could catch this, etc. This is where psychological safety is crucial: the facilitator must set the tone that all questions are welcome and it's a blameless discussion[^5].\n\n- **\"5 Whys\" and beyond:** Use techniques to get past surface symptoms. Ask \"Why\" iteratively until you uncover process or design flaws. If hindsight bias creeps in (\"we should have known X\"), counter it by asking, \"Could we realistically have detected X before? If not, why not? How do we change that?\" Look for systemic patterns. Is this incident part of a trend? (e.g., several incidents in last quarter all related to microservice A or all happening on weekends). I've seen teams start looking at incidents in aggregate and realize that 3 different incidents all stemmed from similar config mistakes; which pointed to a tooling deficiency. Pattern recognition is powerful. In fact, high maturity orgs perform periodic incident trend analysis - Google, for example, aggregates postmortems to spot common themes across products[^5]. In this phase, scour past incident reports for anything similar; it might reveal a latent systemic issue.\n\n- **Human factors:** Investigate not just the technical root cause but the human and organizational factors. Was the runbook misleading? Did alert fatigue cause an alarm to be ignored? Was an engineer new or under pressure? These factors often point to training needs or process improvements. For example, if hindsight shows an engineer misunderstood the failover procedure, the fix might be improving documentation or drills; not just telling them \"be careful.\"\n\n- **Root cause(s) identified:** By day 5-7, you should aim to have a solid understanding of what went wrong, documented in the post-mortem. Ensure the analysis is reviewed by a couple of senior engineers or managers (Google requires peer review of postmortems for completeness[^5]). They should check: Did we get to the real root causes? Are there deeper issues to address? This review also helps eliminate any lingering blamey tone. Settle on 1-3 root causes (if more, prioritize the major ones) and list concrete evidence for each. By the end of [Phase 2](#phase-2-deep-analysis-48-hours---7-days---investigate-thoroughly-and-find-root-causes) (about a week from the incident), the post-mortem report should be complete with analysis and ready for action planning.\n\n### Phase 3: Action Planning (Days 7-14) - Turn insights into measurable improvements\n\nWith causes nailed down, decide what to do about them:\n\n- **Brainstorm and prioritize actions:** The post-mortem team now brainstorms specific preventative or corrective actions for each root cause. Use a prioritization method to rank them. One approach is a Risk Priority Number (\u003Cabbr title=\"Risk Priority Number\">RPN\u003C/abbr>) or simply High/Med/Low by judgment of impact. Focus on actions that reduce the risk of recurrence the most. If there are many suggestions, apply the 80/20 rule; which 20% of fixes will prevent 80% of the risk? For example, \"implement automated integration tests for scenario X\" might be high value, whereas \"consider rewriting module Y someday\" might be shelved. Categorize actions by effort: quick wins vs. long-term. Quick wins (like adding a missing monitor or feature toggle) we try to do immediately (within the next sprint).\n\n- **Set owners and deadlines:** As [Pillar 3](#pillar-3-action-accountability-that-sticks) describes, assign each action to an owner and set a target date. Put these into Linear, or whichever tracking system you use. This is where we establish those 4-week or 8-week \u003Cabbr title=\"Service Level Objectives\">SLOs\u003C/abbr> for critical fixes[^10]. If an action is going to take longer, perhaps set an intermediate milestone (e.g. design completed by X date). By making this plan within ~2 weeks of the incident, you ensure momentum isn't lost.\n\n- **Resource commitment for big changes:** Sometimes the fix might be large; like \"redesign the database architecture\" or \"purchase a new testing tool.\" This may require budget or extra staffing. [Phase 3](#phase-3-action-planning-days-7-14---turn-insights-into-measurable-improvements) is when you escalate to leadership if needed to get resources. If the post-mortem is taken seriously, you'll find execs receptive to allocating resources for reliability improvements (especially if you frame it as \"to prevent a similar $100k outage from happening again\"). Indeed, companies like Google and Amazon explicitly budget for engineering time on post-incident improvements as part of \"keeping the lights on.\" Make the business case if needed, using the incident's impact (revenue loss, customer churn, \u003Cabbr title=\"Service Level Agreement\">SLA\u003C/abbr> penalties) to justify the investment in prevention.\n\n- **Documentation and communication:** Document the action plan clearly in the post-mortem report (e.g. a table of actions with owner, due date, status). Also communicate the plan to stakeholders; e.g., _\"We've identified 5 follow-up actions; two are already done, three will be done by next month, and here's how they'll mitigate the risk.\"_ This closes the loop with anyone (like customer success, executives, or even customers if you publish externally) that the incident is truly being learned from. In some cases, sharing a summary of actions with customers can rebuild trust, especially for major outages. It shows a culture of continuous improvement.\n\n### Phase 4: Learning Integration (Ongoing) - Make improvement continuous and track progress\n\nThis phase is about institutionalizing the process so that over time, the whole org gets safer and more efficient:\n\n- **Monthly tracking and review:** At least once a month, leadership (or an \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr>/\u003Cabbr title=\"Quality Assurance\">QA\u003C/abbr> function) should review open post-mortem actions. This could be as simple as a spreadsheet or Jira filter of \"all postmortem tickets not done\" and checking if any are overdue or stuck. It keeps everyone honest. Some teams implement a 30-minute monthly \"post-mortem review\" meeting where each team quickly updates on their open items. This creates gentle peer pressure to get things done and allows raising blockers (\"we need ops help to complete X\"). Atlassian's engineering managers do similar reviews of any incidents whose fixes haven't been completed[^12]. Regular cadence prevents the \"out of sight, out of mind\" problem.\n\n- **Quarterly trend analysis:** Every quarter or so, take a step back and analyze trends across incidents. For example, categorize the root causes: how many incidents were due to deployments? How many due to third-party outages? How many due to scaling issues? Are the numbers improving quarter over quarter? This is essentially an ops retrospective at a higher level. You might discover systemic needs (e.g., _\"Half our incidents this quarter involved microservice A; maybe we need to refactor it or give that team more support.\"_). Google's \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr> organization has a working group that coordinates postmortem efforts and performs such cross-incident analysis with added metadata and even some tooling/\u003Cabbr title=\"Machine Learning\">ML\u003C/abbr> to spot patterns[^5]. You don't need fancy tools; a spreadsheet or simple database can track incident metadata. **The key is to learn not just from one incident, but from dozens collectively.** That's how you identify \"fragile\" areas of your systems or process gaps that might not be obvious from a single incident.\n\n- **Annual culture review:** It's also worth annually assessing the post-mortem process itself. Survey the engineering org(Do people feel the process is valuable? Do they feel safe being candid? Are post-mortems consistently done for all significant incidents? Use this feedback to tweak your approach. For instance, you might find engineers feel the templates are too heavy, so you simplify them. Or you might discover certain teams aren't doing post-mortems at all; an opportunity to standardize. Measure things like)What % of incidents had a post-mortem completed? (Strive for >90% on any high-severity incidents.) What is our average time to complete a post-mortem? (Maybe improve this over time.) What % of action items got done? These meta-metrics can be part of engineering KPIs. **High-performing orgs treat resilience as a first-class goal and thus monitor these sorts of metrics.**\n\n- **Process refinement:** Finally, feed back improvements into the process. Perhaps you adopt a new tool (like an incident management SaaS) to streamline [Phase 1-3](#phase-1-immediate-response-0-48-hours-after-incident---stabilize-and-record). Or introduce game days (simulated incidents) to practice the process. Or create an internal \"post-mortem of the month\" newsletter (Google does this) to showcase a great analysis and spread knowledge. Keep iterating. The world changes (new tech, bigger scale, etc.), so incident management must evolve too. The fact you're reading this means you care about doing it better; that continuous improvement mindset is exactly what [Phase 4](#phase-4-learning-integration-ongoing---make-improvement-continuous-and-track-progress) is about.\n\nBy following these four phases, you create a closed-loop system: incident happens -> analyze & fix -> share & improve -> next incident is less likely and less severe. It turns the painful moments into productive learnings systematically.\n\n## Proven Implementation Roadmap with Measurable Milestones\n\nIf you're starting from a relatively ad-hoc or blame-oriented post-mortem practice, here is a roadmap to implement the above framework. It's divided into stages with concrete milestones (this is inspired by successful transformations at companies like Google, Etsy, and Atlassian):\n\n### Months 1-3: Cultural Groundwork\n\n- **Leadership kickoff:** Have an executive (\u003Cabbr title=\"Chief Technology Officer\">CTO\u003C/abbr> or Director) announce the shift to blameless post-mortems and why (cite some of the data; e.g., \"80% of our incidents are preventable[^1], we want to learn from them and cut repeats by half\"). This sets the tone top-down.\n\n- **Train facilitators:** Identify a few people (1 per ~50 engineers is a rule of thumb) to be incident facilitators. Train them in the new approach; perhaps via an internal workshop on how to run a blameless post-mortem, how to interview for facts without blame, etc. If you have \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineers\">SREs\u003C/abbr> or a \u003Cabbr title=\"Quality Assurance\">QA\u003C/abbr> team, they often take this role. The facilitators will champion the process in early incidents.\n\n- **Introduce template & tool:** Roll out a standard post-mortem template (one that includes sections for timeline, causes, actions, etc., and explicitly states it's a blameless review). Host it in a tool that everyone can access (Notion, Google Docs, or a specialized incident tool). Make sure it's not cumbersome; maybe one page or two in length. Atlassian found that many companies use very similar templates and you can borrow from industry examples[^10].\n\n- **Set baseline metrics:** Begin tracking a few key metrics from the start: e.g., number of incidents per quarter, post-mortem completion rate, average \u003Cabbr title=\"Mean Time To Recovery\">MTTR\u003C/abbr> (Mean Time to Restore), repeat incident rate (how many incidents were a repeat of a previous issue). Also possibly survey baseline psychological safety (maybe through an anonymous poll). This gives you a way to measure improvement.\n\n- **Quick win:** Encourage sharing of mistakes. Perhaps start a Slack channel #learning where people can drop \"Today I learned we should not… etc.\"; seeded by managers sharing their own goofs. This models blameless behavior. (At Google, they even give little peer bonuses or shout-outs for people who write thorough postmortems of mistakes[^5].)\n\n- **Expected 3-month outcome:** At least one or two post-mortems have been run with the new approach, and the team feedback is positive (\"it felt safe to discuss\"). You might see incident reporting actually rise initially; that's a good sign! A safer culture means more issues get reported rather than hidden[^5].\n\n#### Months 4-6: Process Implementation\n\n- **Formalize the process:** By now, document the full incident response and post-mortem process in an internal playbook. Include phases and responsibilities. For example: _\"For any Severity-1 incident, an incident post-mortem issue must be created within 24 hours and completed within 5 business days. The incident commander ensures this happens; a facilitator is assigned…\"_ etc. **It doesn't have to be bureaucratic, just clear.** Atlassian's incident management handbook is a great reference[^10]. Formalizing it helps ensure consistency across teams.\n\n- **Automate tracking:** Set up an action item tracker. This could be a Jira project or Trello board specifically for post-mortem actions. Use labels or links to tie them to the incident. Enable notifications or reminders for due dates. **The goal is to make it easy to see the status of all improvements.** Many teams integrate this with Slack; e.g., a weekly digest of all open incident tasks. Little automation tweaks go a long way in sustaining [Pillar 3](#pillar-3-action-accountability-that-sticks).\n\n- **Introduce \"Wheel of Misfortune\" (optional but fun):** The \"Wheel of Misfortune\" is an exercise (pioneered by Google \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr>[^5], and adopted by others like Netflix) where you role-play an incident using a past post-mortem. Engineers take on roles (pager, on-call, etc.) and work through the scenario in real-time. It's basically a fire-drill that simultaneously trains people and reinforces why the process exists. By month 6, try running a Wheel of Misfortune session. It will reveal any gaps in your process in a safe environment and also further normalize incident discussion. Plus, it's a surprisingly good team bonding experience; nothing brings engineers together quite like collectively debugging a fictional disaster.\n\n- **Community of practice:** Start a monthly incident review meeting (cross-team). In months 4-6, this can be low-key: pick one interesting incident and have the team walk through their post-mortem to an audience of other engineers. Peer review and knowledge sharing happen naturally here. It also builds skills; less experienced teams learn how to do better post-mortems by hearing from more experienced teams. Google's \"Postmortem of the Month\" internal newsletter serves a similar purpose. By month 6, aim to have at least one cross-team review done.\n\n- **Expected 6-month outcome:** The median time to complete a post-mortem is shrinking (say from two weeks to one week). The completion rate of action items is improving (maybe from 50% to >70%). You might target 50% reduction in post-mortem document completion time by standardizing templates and training, and indeed teams often report that once a template and workflow are in place, writing reports is much faster. Psychological safety scores should tick up (e.g., from 3.x to 4.x on a 5-point scale in team surveys). You should also see fewer repeat incidents by now; maybe a 15% reduction compared to last quarter; because some systemic fixes have been implemented. And importantly, engineers start to say, \"post-mortems are actually useful\" instead of \"post-mortems are a chore.\" That mindset shift is critical and tends to happen once they see a few concrete improvements come out of the process.\n\n#### Months 7-12: Scaling and Refinement\n\n- **Expand to all teams:** Ensure that by the end of the year, all engineering teams are following the post-mortem process for their significant incidents. Often, early on it might be \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr> or Ops teams doing it, but by month 12, Dev teams, Security teams, etc., should also adopt it. Provide support to teams that have fewer incidents (maybe pair a facilitator with them the first time).\n\n- **Periodic retro on the process:** Do a retrospective on the incident program itself in month 9 or so. Gather feedback: what's working, what's not? Maybe developers want the postmortem meeting sooner, or a better tool, etc. Refine accordingly. This is continuous improvement on the process. I've seen teams do one after 9 months and realize they needed a better way to share lessons learned; which led to implementing a lightweight internal blog for incident write-ups. Little tweaks can maintain momentum.\n\n- **Advanced analytics:** If you have enough data points by month 12, consider more advanced analysis. For example, calculate your \u003Cabbr title=\"Mean Time To Recovery\">MTTR\u003C/abbr> (Mean Time to Resolution) at start vs. end of year. If you started at, say, 2 hours average, see if it's down to 1.5 hours (20-25% improvement) by better practices. Track the near-misses reported; perhaps initially you had few, but now more are being logged (that's actually positive, showing openness). High-performing orgs also measure things like \"customer-impacting incidents per quarter\" aiming to reduce that through preventative fixes.\n\n- **Celebrate wins:** This is important for culture. By end of year, call out the improvements achieved. E.g., \"We've reduced repeat incidents by 75%\" or \"\u003Cabbr title=\"Mean Time To Recovery\">MTTR\u003C/abbr> improved by 20%\" or \"We caught 10 incidents preemptively via new alerts.\" Recognize the people who implemented key fixes (maybe an award for \"Best Incident Recovery\" or just a shout-out in all-hands). Google's \u003Cabbr title=\"Thank God It's Friday\">TGIF\u003C/abbr> example where an engineer got applause for a quick rollback and a great postmortem is instructive; they celebrated incident handling[^5]. Create your own version of that. It solidifies the cultural change that learning from failure is valued.\n\n### Expected 12-month goals\n\nHere are some targets to aim for by end of Year 1:\n\n- **Post-mortem participation:** 100% of major incidents have a post-mortem completed. Stakeholder participation (dev, ops, product as needed) in reviews is over 80%.\n- **Action completion:** High completion rate of priority action items within their \u003Cabbr title=\"Service Level Objective\">SLO\u003C/abbr>. (Effective teams establish clear tracking and ownership to drive consistent follow-through[^10][^11].)\n- **Reduction in repeats:** Repeat incident rate (same issue happening again) is below 10% of total incidents. Essentially, almost no exact repeats because you are fixing root causes.\n- **\u003Cabbr title=\"Mean Time To Recovery\">MTTR\u003C/abbr> improvement:** 30% faster incident resolution on average. This comes from better preparedness and faster detection. For example, if MTTR was 1 hour, it is now down to ~40 minutes.\n- **Near-miss reporting:** At least 50% increase in near-miss or minor incident reports. (This indicates people are proactively catching and reporting issues that didn't become big incidents, a hallmark of a learning org.)\n- **Psychological safety:** Team surveys show psychological safety >= 4.0 out of 5. People feel comfortable admitting mistakes. You can gauge this also by the tone in incident reviews; if you regularly hear \"I felt safe bringing this up,\" that's success.\n\nThese numbers will vary by organization, but the point is to have concrete success metrics. By treating post-mortem improvement as a project with milestones, you ensure it gets the attention it deserves. Too often, reliability initiatives are fuzzy; but as the above shows, you can make it as measurable as any feature launch. And a year is a realistic timeframe to go from ad-hoc to world-class in incident management, as long as there is commitment.\n\n### Success Metrics by Timeline\n\nTo summarize some key indicators and targets over the implementation timeline:\n\n#### 30-Day Indicators:\n\n- Post-mortem completion rate above 90% for all qualifying incidents (immediately start closing the gap of any incidents that slipped by without a review).\n- Template adoption is above 80% (most teams using the new format).\n- 75% of incident post-mortems have all relevant stakeholders contributing (shows buy-in).\n\n#### 3-Month Targets:\n\n- Psychological safety sentiment up (e.g., via a quick pulse survey - _\"I feel safe admitting mistakes\"_; strong agreement increasing by 10-20%).\n- Incident reporting rate up (more openness; possibly a jump in the count of incident reports, including minor ones, as people become less fearful).\n- At least one cross-team learning exercise completed (wheel of misfortune or multi-team review).\n\n#### 6-Month Targets:\n\n- Average post-mortem completion time is less than 5 days (if it used to take weeks).\n- 70% of identified action items completed or in progress.\n- 15% reduction in repeat incidents (compare last 3 months to previous).\n- \u003Cabbr title=\"Mean Time To Recovery\">MTTR\u003C/abbr> trending downward (measure over last few incidents versus prior baseline).\n\n#### 12-Month Goals:\n\n- Incident frequency down (maybe fewer total major incidents as preventative fixes kick in; e.g., a 20% drop year-over-year, if externally possible).\n- \u003Cabbr title=\"Mean Time To Recovery\">MTTR\u003C/abbr> improved by ~30%.\n- Customer-impacting outages significantly reduced in severity/impact (could be measured by total downtime minutes, which ideally drop).\n- Post-mortem process satisfaction(high (could poll engineers)e.g., 90% say the process is useful and blame-free).\n- A repository of dozens of post-mortems exists that is being actively used for training and reference.\n\nThe exact metrics will depend on your starting point, but having these goals keeps the program outcome-focused. Remember, the ultimate goal is fewer and less severe incidents in the future, and a culture that handles the ones that do happen in a blameless, efficient way.\n\n## Real-World Success Stories\n\nTo convince any skeptics (maybe that grizzled director or the busy \u003Cabbr title=\"Chief Technology Officer\">CTO\u003C/abbr> who wonders if this is worth it), let's look at a couple of real-world success stories where robust post-mortem practices paid off:\n\n### Google SRE: The Gold Standard\n\nGoogle literally wrote the book on Site Reliability Engineering, and their postmortem culture is legendary. They credit a blameless, data-driven incident review process with helping Google scale its infrastructure without as many outages as one might expect for its size. In the Google \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr> Book, it's noted that thanks to continuous investment in postmortem culture, Google \"weathers fewer outages and fosters a better user experience.\" In practice, what does Google do? A few insights:\n\n- They have a **Postmortem Working Group** that ensures lessons are shared across the whole company[^5]. If YouTube has an incident, Gmail's team might learn from it too. They even add machine-readable metadata to postmortems so they can run trend analysis and pattern recognition at scale; essentially using AI internally to predict where the next incident might happen based on past data.\n\n- **Blameless culture at the top:** Google's leadership (even founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin) publicly praise teams for honest postmortems. There's a famous anecdote of a \u003Cabbr title=\"Thank God It's Friday\">TGIF\u003C/abbr> company meeting focused on \"The Art of the Postmortem\"; an engineer described how a change he made took down a service for four minutes, but because he rolled it back fast and wrote a thorough postmortem, he was applauded by thousands of Googlers including the \u003Cabbr title=\"Chief Executive Officer\">CEO\u003C/abbr>[^5]. That kind of recognition sends a strong signal to every employee: it's safe to admit mistakes and smart to learn from them. Google even has a peer bonus program where fellow engineers can nominate someone for a reward if they handled an incident well or wrote a particularly enlightening postmortem[^5].\n\n- **Outcomes:** Google's postmortems are not just documents; they drive engineering work. It's said that many of their infrastructure improvements (better load balancers, more resilient storage systems, etc.) were sparked by postmortem findings. Over time, this has contributed to Google's ability to have very high uptime across products. Also, their culture of sharing failures openly (internally) has made engineers more willing to take informed risks and innovate, because they know if something goes wrong it won't be a career-ending blame fest; it will be a learning opportunity[^7]. That psychological safety is a foundation of their performance.\n\n### Netflix: From Chaos to Resilience\n\nNetflix is another industry leader that takes incidents and learning seriously. A few years ago, Netflix's rapid growth meant they had more incidents and needed a better way to handle them. Initially, Netflix teams were using a single Slack channel for all incident chatter (imagine hundreds of engineers and alerts in one channel!). They realized this wasn't sustainable; important signals were getting lost in noise. So Netflix developed an internal tool called Dispatch to streamline incident management. Dispatch automatically creates a dedicated Slack channel for each incident, brings in the relevant people, and integrates with PagerDuty, Jira, Google Docs, etc., to centralize information[^20]. This eliminated the overload of one channel and ensured each incident was managed in an organized \"virtual war room.\" It's essentially institutionalizing [Pillar 3](#pillar-3-action-accountability-that-sticks) (action tracking) by automating a lot of the busywork of incident coordination.\n\nNetflix also pioneered Chaos Engineering; e.g., unleashing Chaos Monkey to randomly break things in production; with the philosophy that it's better to proactively find weaknesses than react after a crash[^17]. This practice works hand-in-hand with post-mortems(every chaos test that surfaces a weakness is treated like a mini-incident with analysis and fixes, before customers are ever impacted[^21]. Over time, Netflix built incredibly resilient systems that can survive instance failures, \u003Cabbr title=\"Availability Zone\">AZ\u003C/abbr> outages, even regional failures, with minimal customer impact. Their culture is often summed up by the term \"antifragile\"; systems that improve through chaos. But underlying that is the human element)**engineers at Netflix have the freedom to experiment and fail safely because of a culture of learning** (their culture famously prioritizes freedom and responsibility).\n\nNetflix's engineering leadership has talked about the \"paved road\" approach: they provide a well-supported set of tools and best practices (the paved road) that make doing the right things easy for engineers[^21]. Following the paved road (which includes using Dispatch for incidents, writing postmortems, building in reliability) is optional but encouraged; and most engineers choose to, because it's the path of least resistance and greatest support[^21]. This organically drives adoption of good practices, rather than mandating via policy. The result? Netflix's services have become highly resilient. They openly share many of their learnings on their tech blog so the industry can learn (true blameless culture extends externally too; they're not shy about admitting outages in public blog posts and describing how they fixed them).\n\n#### The common thread: leadership and culture \n\nIn both Google and Netflix (and others like Amazon, Etsy, Microsoft), the leaders set the expectation that incidents will happen (failure is inevitable in complex systems) but that learning from them is a top priority. They allocate time, tools, and praise to the post-mortem process. They avoid knee-jerk blame (for example, Amazon has a \"Correction of Error\" process that is blameless and data-focused, very similar to what we've outlined). These companies turned their incident management into a competitive advantage; they iterate and improve faster than others. While some competitors might hide failures or scapegoat, these leaders broadcast lessons internally (and sometimes externally), gaining trust and improving reliability.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025 and beyond, the organizations that will dominate are those that treat resilience as a core competency. **Incidents can be a competitive advantage if handled right: every outage is a free penetration test of your system's defenses.** The faster and more deeply you learn from it, the stronger you get. Companies stuck in blame cycles stagnate and keep tripping over the same problems, which gives an edge to those who learn and adapt.\n\n#### Future trends:\n\nWe're also seeing the rise of AI-assisted incident analysis; tools that can sift through logs and past incidents to suggest root causes or even predict incidents. (Google mentions future use of ML to predict weaknesses from postmortem data[^5].) Predictive failure modeling, self-healing systems; those are on the horizon. But here's the kicker: none of that works without the human foundation of honesty and learning. **If your incident data is garbage because people hid the truth or didn't record details, AI won't magically save you.** The fancy tools require rich, accurate postmortems and an open culture to function. In other words, psychological safety and a learning culture are the fuel for these advanced techniques. As CTOs and engineering directors, our job is to create that culture now, so we can harness those technologies tomorrow.\n\n## Supporting Research and Data\n\nLet's recap some of the key statistics and sources that back up this approach:\n\n- **Internal Changes Cause 80% of Incidents:** A 2024 study of fintech post-mortems found 80% of major incidents were triggered by internal changes (deployments, config updates); often due to inadequate testing or change controls[^1]. This underscores the need for rigorous pre-prod testing and change management as part of incident prevention.\n\n- **Lack of Monitoring in 69% of Incidents:** The same study showed 69% of incidents lacked proactive alerts, delaying detection[^1]. In other words, better monitoring could have caught two-thirds of failures sooner. This supports investing in observability and on-call training to improve \u003Cabbr title=\"Mean Time To Recovery\">MTTR\u003C/abbr>.\n\n- **Psychological Safety is the Top Team Performance Factor:** Google's Project Aristotle research (2015) concluded that psychological safety was the top differentiator of high-performance teams[^3]. Teams that feel safe to speak up drive better outcomes; relevant not just for reliability, but all of engineering.\n\n- **High-Safety Teams Report ~50% More Errors:** Studies by Amy Edmondson and others found that teams with strong psychological safety report significantly more mistakes (one finding was +47% error reporting) because team members feel safe to admit and discuss them[^4]. Those teams didn't make more mistakes; they surfaced them, which allowed them to fix issues and learn.\n\n- **Action Item Completion Gap:** Many organizations struggle with completing post-mortem action items. Atlassian research shows that subpar postmortems with incomplete action items make incident recurrence far more likely, and action items without clear owners are significantly less likely to be resolved[^10]. Organizations that establish systematic tracking, clear ownership, and management oversight see much higher completion rates and correspondingly lower repeat incident rates, emphasizing the importance of accountability and follow-through.\n\n- **Experienced Investigators Have Biases:** Research and expert practitioners note that even seasoned incident investigators can fall prey to cognitive biases (hindsight, confirmation bias). Studies show that very experienced investigators often default to familiar causes and can miss novel issues[^9]. This reinforces using structured methods and reviews to counteract bias.\n\n- **Blameless Culture Reduces Outages:** Google's \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr> documentation states that a blameless postmortem culture resulted in fewer outages and better user experiences at Google[^16]. In essence, learning from every failure made the systems more reliable over time. Similarly, an Atlassian report notes that effective postmortems (blameless, with follow-through) help reduce incident recurrence[^10].\n\n- **Aviation's Near-100% Reporting:** The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) is a model for incident reporting. It's voluntary and non-punitive. As a result, it has amassed over 1.7 million reports and boasts extremely high participation from pilots and air traffic controllers. **Over 95% of professionals contribute at least one report in their career.** This wealth of data has been crucial in identifying patterns (like cockpit communication issues) and improving aviation safety. It exemplifies how blame-free reporting leads to system-wide improvements. (Source: NASA ASRS Program Briefings)\n\n- **Cost of Downtime:** To underscore why all this matters to the business: Gartner has estimated the average cost of IT downtime at $5,600 per minute (~$300k per hour)[^13]. For high-traffic services it can be even higher. So preventing even a single major incident or reducing its duration by half an hour can save hundreds of thousands in revenue; not to mention intangible costs like customer trust. Post-mortem improvements have real ROI.\n\n- **Employee Burnout & Attrition:** Beyond reliability improvements, PagerDuty found that organizations with better incident practices (automated alerting, blameless culture) had 21% lower on-call attrition[^2]. Employees were less fried and more likely to stay when the incident process was humane and effective. This is a point a VP of Engineering will care about; strong incident management can improve engineer retention.\n\n## Addressing Common Leadership Concerns\n\nBefore we conclude, let's tackle a few pushbacks you might hear from CTOs, directors, or team leads when proposing these changes; and how to respond:\n\n#### \"Won't a 'blameless' approach make engineers less accountable?\"\n\n*Concern:* Some managers worry that if nobody is blamed, people won't take incidents seriously or might be careless.\n\n*Response:* In reality, blameless post-mortems create more accountability, not less; just a different kind. People are held accountable for learning and improving, rather than shamed for failures. Google and Etsy's experiences show engineers actually come forward and own up to mistakes more readily in a blameless culture[^7]. And importantly, accountability still exists in other channels: if someone is habitually underperforming, you handle that via performance management. **But the post-mortem arena is for truth-finding, not disciplinary action.** Blame breeds cover-ups (as Zwieback noted, people with info will withhold it to avoid punishment[^7]), whereas blamelessness breeds openness. The result is faster resolution and more reliable systems; which is accountability to the business. **Emphasize that we're not ignoring responsibility; we're clarifying it** (responsibility to improve the system, rather than pin fault on an individual). And of course, any willful negligence or malicious act would be handled outside the normal post-mortem process (but those are exceedingly rare in a professional environment).\n\n#### \"We don't have time for all these follow-ups and meetings.\"\n\n*Concern:* Teams are busy with product deadlines; managers fear the overhead of thorough post-mortems and action items will slow down feature delivery.\n\n*Response:* It's true there is an investment of time, but it's one that pays back by preventing future incidents (and their far worse disruption). Remind them of the downtime cost figures; e.g. $300k/hour[^13]; and ask, can we afford not to invest a few hours to potentially save an outage later? Also, much of the process can be made efficient: **post-mortems don't have to be long meetings** (they can be 30 minutes if well-prepared), and tracking actions can be part of existing workflows. Many companies find that as they get better at it, a standard post-mortem write-up might take only an hour or two of work spread across a couple people; a small price for the insight gained. Additionally, preventing one major incident through a fix could save dozens of hours of firefighting later. It's a classic pay-now or pay-later scenario. You can also start small (only high-severity incidents) to manage load. Once the benefits become evident (reduced incidents, less firefighting at 2 AM), teams usually become grateful for the process.\n\n#### \"Our incidents are all unique, is it worth standardizing this much?\"\n\n*Concern:* A lead might say \"every outage is different, we handle things case-by-case; a rigid process might not fit.\"\n\n*Response:* While every incident has unique aspects, studies show there are often common failure patterns[^5]. Standardizing how we investigate and learn ensures that we consistently identify those patterns. A flexible template actually helps even with unique incidents, because it prompts us to consider areas we might otherwise ignore (e.g., \"What went well\"; even unique incidents have some good practices to reinforce). You can assure them the **process isn't about bureaucracy, it's about making sure we don't skip steps in the heat of the moment.** Also, standardization allows cross-team collaboration; if everyone uses a similar format, it's easier to read each other's reports and share knowledge. Companies like Atlassian and Amazon have standardized postmortem templates precisely so lessons can be consumed company-wide[^10]. We can always adapt the process as we learn, but having none is a bigger risk. Think of it like surgeons using a pre-surgery checklist; yes every surgery is unique, but the checklist (a standard process) dramatically reduces errors.\n\n#### \"What if an engineer truly violated best practices or was negligent? No blame at all?\"\n\n*Concern:* Directors might wonder if someone does something reckless, do they just get off scot-free in a blameless world.\n\n*Response:* Blameless post-mortem does not mean no accountability or no disciplinary action ever; it means that **the analysis process is kept separate from discipline.** If someone ignored protocol or did something they knew was against rules, that's a performance/\u003Cabbr title=\"Human Resources\">HR\u003C/abbr> issue, which can be handled by their manager privately. It doesn't need to be a public flogging in the incident review. In fact, mixing the two is counterproductive; others will become less forthcoming. You can follow a \"just culture\" approach: console human error, coach at-risk behavior, and only discipline reckless behavior (and such recklessness is extremely rare)[^22]. In practice, we've found that clear protocols and training reduce negligent errors to near-zero. Most incidents are system problems or unintentional slips. If you ever do have a case of, say, an engineer being intoxicated on call (truly egregious), that can be handled outside the post-mortem meeting. **Blameless doesn't mean no one is ever fired for cause; it means no one is unfairly blamed for systemic issues outside their control.**\n\n#### \"Will this really improve uptime/customer trust?\"\n\n*Concern:* The exec needs to justify that this investment has tangible business outcomes, not just internal feel-good improvements.\n\n*Response:* Yes; the data and case studies show a direct link to reliability and customer satisfaction. By preventing repeat incidents and reducing MTTR, you increase uptime, which means higher \u003Cabbr title=\"Service Level Agreement\">SLA\u003C/abbr> compliance and less customer churn. Google's and Amazon's high availability is in part due to their incident learning processes (they've said as much in \u003Cabbr title=\"Site Reliability Engineering\">SRE\u003C/abbr> case studies). Also, communicating postmortem findings to customers increases transparency, which many customers appreciate. For example, when Cloudflare or Stripe publish a detailed outage analysis, customers often respond positively, saying it builds trust that the company is competent and honest. So there's a competitive edge: **many enterprises now require their vendors to have a good incident response program** (some even ask for evidence of post-mortems in \u003Cabbr title=\"Request For Proposals\">RFPs\u003C/abbr>). By implementing this, we're not only preventing outages, we're showing our clients that we run a tight, learning-focused operation. And internally, we'll see benefits like less firefighting (so more time for features) and better morale (engineers hate repeat outages too!). In short, this directly supports our reliability goals which tie to revenue protection and brand reputation.\n\nEach of these concerns is valid, and it's good that leaders voice them. By addressing them with evidence and clear reasoning, you can get buy-in. Many forward-looking tech leaders (at firms like Google, Netflix, etc.) are already advocates of these practices; **often what's needed is to connect the dots between these \"soft\" cultural changes and hard business metrics.** Fortunately, as we've outlined, the connection is there and backed by research.\n\n## Your 90-Day Implementation Roadmap\n\nWe've covered a lot. To conclude, let's boil it down into a 90-day action plan to get started on transforming your post-mortems. If you're a startup or mid-size engineering org, here's a pragmatic rollout:\n\n### Month 1: Lay the Foundation\n\n- **Announce the initiative:** Kick off at an all-hands or engineering meeting. Leadership should explain the why; perhaps share one of the data points (e.g., \"47% more errors get reported in high-trust teams[^5]\") to highlight why psychological safety matters, or mention a recent incident that could have been prevented with deeper learning. Make a public commitment to blameless postmortems.\n\n- **Publish a [blameless post-mortem policy](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Blameless-Post-Mortem-Policy-26e6edefd08e80dbbcffce0093471840):** A short doc or wiki page stating the principles (no blame, root cause focus, etc.). Have the CTO or VP endorse it. This acts as a reference everyone can point to if old habits creep back.\n\n- **Choose a pilot incident:** Identify an incident (maybe a Sev-2 that happened this month) and conduct a post-mortem using the new approach. Use the template, assign a facilitator, get the team in a room. Treat it as a learning moment for the org. Afterwards, ask the participants how it went and gather feedback.\n\n- **Success metric:** By the end of month one, your team(s) should have at least one successful blameless post-mortem under their belt, and importantly the team felt safe to discuss mistakes openly. You can gauge this if people were candid in the meeting and if the written report has honest details (e.g., _\"we didn't know how the feature flag worked\"_ admissions). If you sense people still holding back, reinforce the blameless message and perhaps have the facilitator follow up 1:1 to get the full story and reassure them. Real psychological safety might take a bit longer, but even in one incident you often notice a difference (_\"wow, we actually talked about our slip-ups without drama\"_). That's a great start.\n\n### Month 2: Establish the Process\n\n- **Standardize templates & tracking:** Roll out the post-mortem template to all teams. Create a central folder or system for storing them. Also introduce whatever tracking tool you'll use for action items (even if it's just a tab on your project tracker). This month is about putting the lightweight \"process rails\" in place.\n\n- **Train or brief all on-call engineers:** Take some time in on-call training or team meetings to brief people on how incidents will be handled going forward. Emphasize things like: don't fear admitting an error; we separate accountability from blame, we only want to learn. Also remind them to log timelines during incidents. Essentially, socialize the expectations so everyone knows what to do when an incident hits.\n\n- **Begin pattern spotting:** If you have multiple incidents this month, see if you can start connecting dots. Maybe two incidents had the same contributing factor (e.g., code review missed something). Flag that as a pattern to address. This is the start of \"proactive\" improvement. You might not have enough data yet, but keep the idea alive. Perhaps start an \"Incident Dashboard\" tracking causes and actions.\n\n- **Execute quick wins:** Aim to complete at least 70% of the action items identified in month one's postmortem by end of month two. **Early visible wins build credibility.** For example, if an action was \"add missing database timeout alert,\" get it done in week five. Then if a similar issue happens, the alert will fire and everyone sees \"hey, that fix saved us.\" Advertise those wins (\"because we fixed X, we caught Y issue before it became an incident\"). This encourages the team that the process leads to positive change.\n\n- **Success metric:** By end of month two, you want to see most action items (>70%) from the pilot incidents are completed. Also, ensure every new significant incident in month two gets a blameless post-mortem (completion rate ~100% for Sev1/Sev2). Another metric: engagement; are people contributing to the analysis? If one or two people are writing the whole report and others are silent, it might indicate lack of buy-in. **Ideally, you have multiple contributors and reviewers for each postmortem** (participation > X people, depending on team size). Culturally, a good sign is people start asking after an incident, _\"When's the postmortem? I have thoughts\"_; that shows the process is becoming ingrained.\n\n### Month 3: Scale and Solidify\n\n- **Extend cross-team:** Have teams present post-mortems to each other or at least share them in a common repo. This fosters broader learning. Maybe introduce a short segment in the engineering all-hands: \"Incident Learning of the Month\" highlighting a key lesson (without blame). This keeps everyone aware and demonstrates leadership's support.\n\n- **Conduct a 3-month review:** Evaluate how the process is going. Gather feedback via a quick survey or retrospective. Address any concerns. For example, maybe developers say \"the template is too long\"; you could shorten it. Or an ops person says \"devs aren't showing up to postmortems\"; then managers need to enforce that priority. Use this to course-correct early.\n\n- **Reinforce training:** By now, newer engineers or those outside core ops should also be looped in. Maybe hold a brown-bag session on \"how to run a blameless postmortem\" using real examples from last 2 months. Invite everyone. This spreads the knowledge wider.\n\n- **Celebrate & normalize:** Publicly acknowledge improvements achieved in the last 90 days. E.g., _\"We've resolved 10 follow-up actions that make us safer; kudos to A, B, C for driving those.\"_ Also acknowledge people who contributed candid analysis. This positive reinforcement in a public forum goes a long way to normalize the behavior. **It's no longer strange to talk about failure; it's just part of our job.**\n\n- **Success metric:** By the end of Month three, aim for over 15% reduction in repeat incidents (if you had any repeats at all to measure; if not, measure overall incident frequency or \u003Cabbr title=\"Mean Time To Recovery\">MTTR\u003C/abbr> improvements). Another metric could be time to postmortem completion; is it decreasing as teams get used to it (maybe from 7 days down to 3 on average). And qualitatively, the conversation around incidents should feel different; more constructive, less finger-pointy. If you informally poll the team _\"Do you feel our incident process is better now?\"_, you're hoping for a resounding yes. Engineers might even start suggesting further improvements on their own, which is a sign of true ownership of the process.\n\n#### Beyond 90 days\n\nContinue with the momentum into the roadmap I outlined in Section five (Months 4-12). The first 3 months are the hardest culturally; once you pass that and people see the value, the rest is about refinement and sustaining.\n\n#### What's your first step?\n\nPerhaps the simplest call to action is(pick the next incident that occurs (there's always a next one!) and commit to trying the blameless approach on it. Don't wait for a perfect moment. When it happens, gather the team and explicitly say)\"We're going to do this postmortem a bit differently; blameless, focused on system issues. Let's ask 'what' and 'how' instead of 'why' and 'who'.\"\n\nUse this [Post-Mortem Cheat Sheet](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Post-Mortem-Cheat-Sheet-27b6edefd08e807ab127d93c09411e63) to guide your first blameless post-mortem. See how much more you learn. Even if the improvement is small (say you discover one deeper cause you'd have overlooked), that's progress. Then build on it.\n\n#### The bottom line\n\nEngineering leaders who master this framework will build more resilient systems and stronger teams, and ultimately deliver more reliable products to customers. **Incidents are inevitable; but wasting them is optional.** You can either continue with \"blame theater\" and fight the same fires repeatedly, or you can turn every incident into fuel for improvement. The data and experiences of elite teams show that the latter approach pays off massively. The choice is yours as a leader.\n\nI'll close with this: in the tech world, everyone experiences failure; the winners are defined by how they respond. **By fostering a culture where failures are openly examined and truly fixed, you create an organization that learns faster than the competition.** And in a fast-moving industry, that might be the greatest competitive advantage of all.\n\nIncidents are inevitable; but wasting them is optional. You can either continue with \"blame theater\" and fight the same fires repeatedly, or you can turn every incident into fuel for improvement. The choice is yours as a leader. Here's to fewer incidents; and when they do happen, never letting a good crisis go to waste!\n\n## Process Guardrails\n\n- **48-hour draft rule:** Complete initial post-mortem draft within 48 hours while details are fresh\n- **85% closure target:** Maintain >85% action item completion rate with clear owners and deadlines\n- **Systemic framing:** Focus on \"what conditions enabled this\" rather than \"who made the mistake\"\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Post-Mortem Cheat Sheet](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Post-Mortem-Cheat-Sheet-27b6edefd08e807ab127d93c09411e63) – free quick-reference checklist\n- [Post-Mortem Template](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Incident-Postmortem-Template-Blameless-26e6edefd08e80c6829bfffe0e2293fe) – free, ready-to-use Notion template\n- [Blameless Post-Mortem Policy](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Blameless-Post-Mortem-Policy-26e6edefd08e80dbbcffce0093471840) – ready-to-implement blameless policy framework\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[^1]: (PDF) Analyzing Systemic Failures in IT Incident Management: Insights from Post-Mortem Analysis https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391475264_Analyzing_Systemic_Failures_in_IT_Incident_Management_Insights_from_Post-Mortem_Analysis\n\n[^2]: The Cost of Operational Immaturity | PagerDuty https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/digital-operations/cost-of-operational-immaturity/\n\n[^3]: Psychological Safety is the #1 Factor of Effective Teams | PACEsConnection https://www.pacesconnection.com/blog/psychological-safety-is-the-1-factor-of-effective-teams\n\n[^4]: Edmondson, A.

High-performing organizations virtually eliminate repeat failures: **elite teams prevent ~95% of repeat incidents**, whereas average teams get stuck in a costly blame-fix-repeat cycle. From the executive lens, this translates to real business impact. While average teams firefight the same problems quarterly, elite teams redirect that engineering time toward innovation.\n\n## The Hidden Costs\n\nThe financial stakes are significant:\n- Gartner estimates downtime costs ~$5,600 per minute on average[¹³](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-13)\n- Organizations with poor incident practices have 21% higher on-call attrition[²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-2)\n- Companies implementing systematic post-incident improvements see up to 50% fewer repeat incidents[¹²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-12)\n\nBut the real cost isn't just downtime: it's opportunity cost. Every hour engineers spend firefighting repeat incidents is an hour not spent building features that drive revenue.\n\n## The Three-Pillar Solution\n\nLeading organizations transform their relationship with failure through three fundamental shifts:\n\n### Pillar 1: Psychological Safety Infrastructure\n\nBlameless by design, not by wishful thinking. When engineers fear blame, the whole post-mortem process becomes superficial. **Google's research found that psychological safety was the #1 predictor of team performance**.[³](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-3) In high-safety teams, members report significantly more errors, not because they make more mistakes, but because they feel safe admitting them.[⁴](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-4) This openness surfaces problems early, while blame-driven cultures drive them underground.\n\nBusiness impact: Teams with blameless cultures suffer fewer outages and deliver better user experiences.[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5) When people freely share information and concerns, incidents are resolved faster and future risks are caught earlier.\n\n### Pillar 2: Systems Thinking Over Person-Hunting\n\nFocus on conditions, not culprits. In complex systems, failures almost never result from one person or one glitch; they result from multiple contributing factors aligning. **By asking \"How did our system allow this?\" instead of \"Who did this?\", you reveal deeper fixes that prevent entire classes of incidents.**\n\nBusiness impact: This approach addresses root causes rather than symptoms, preventing not just the same incident but similar ones. It also avoids the morale-killing blame games that drive talent away.\n\n### Pillar 3: Action Accountability That Sticks\n\nClose the execution gap. Even when post-mortems identify valuable fixes, execution is where most teams stumble. Without clear ownership and deadlines, follow-ups languish in backlogs. **Leading teams assign every action item to an individual owner with realistic deadlines and track completion rates as seriously as uptime metrics.**\n\nBusiness impact: Organizations with systematic action item tracking see dramatically lower repeat incident rates. The completion gap is what separates incremental learning from real resilience.\n\n## The ROI of Getting This Right\n\nCompanies that implement this framework see measurable returns:\n- **Reliability:** 50% reduction in repeat incidents within 12 months[¹²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-12)\n- **Efficiency:** 30% faster incident resolution on average[¹²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-12)\n- **Retention:** Lower on-call burnout and attrition[²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-2)\n- **Trust:** Customer confidence from transparent, systematic improvement[¹⁸](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-18)\n\nMore importantly, you create a competitive advantage. While competitors hide failures or scapegoat individuals, your organization broadcasts lessons internally, gaining trust and improving reliability faster than the market.\n\n## Your Next Step\n\nIf this resonates, you have two options for implementation:\n\n- **For managers and leads:** Read the [Field Guide](/articles/post-mortem-field-guide) (20 minutes) for actionable structure and a 90-day rollout plan.

Teams write detailed reports, assign action items that never get completed, then act surprised when the same incident happens again. But the best engineering organizations have cracked the code on incident learning: they've built cultures where failures become fuel for improvement and the same incident almost never happens twice.\n\n> **Need just the big picture?** Start with the [Executive Brief](/articles/post-mortem-executive-brief) (7 min). **Want the complete research and success stories?** Read the [Definitive Guide](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide) (60 min, canonical).\n\n![Ranger bear packing a backpack with compass, map, and tools.](incidents-b-supplies.webp)\n\n## The Reality Check\n\nA director explained the same database timeout issue for the third time in six months. Each incident write-up blamed a different team member, but the root cause never changed. This isn't rare; it's common when post-mortems are treated as formality or finger-pointing exercises.\n\nThe brutal data: **80% of incidents stem from internal changes** that weren't tested properly, and **69% lack proactive alerts**.[¹](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-1) Most outages are self-inflicted and caught too late. Elite teams prevent ~95% of repeat incidents, while average teams get stuck in costly blame-fix-repeat cycles.\n\n## Why Smart Teams Keep Making Dumb Mistakes\n\nEven capable teams fall into traps that render post-mortems ineffective. Three silent killers destroy the learning process:\n\n### Silent Killer 1: Lack of Psychological Safety\n\nWhen engineers fear blame, post-mortems become superficial exercises. Google's research found that **psychological safety was the #1 predictor of team performance**.[³](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-3) Without it, incidents turn into information warfare: people hide crucial facts to avoid embarrassment.\n\nIn high-safety teams, members report significantly more errors, not because they make more mistakes, but because they feel safe admitting them.[⁴](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-4) This openness surfaces problems early, while blame-driven cultures drive them underground.\n\n### Silent Killer 2: Cognitive Biases and Hindsight Blind Spots\n\nAfter an incident, it's human nature to ask \"who missed the warning signs?\" This falls victim to hindsight bias, making past events seem obvious. We conclude we \"should have known\" things that were actually unknowable beforehand.\n\nThese biases infect even veteran investigators, leading to shallow conclusions and vague \"be more careful\" action items. The true contributing causes (design flaws, insufficient tests, ambiguous runbooks) remain unaddressed.\n\n### Silent Killer 3: The Action-Item \"Death Spiral\"\n\nEven when post-mortems identify valuable fixes, execution falters. Without clear ownership and deadlines, follow-ups languish in backlogs. Less than 50% of organizations have mature incident learning processes; those that do enjoy substantially fewer repeat outages.\n\nThe result: the same incident recurs because underlying vulnerabilities remain. Leadership has false security because there's a nice post-mortem document filed away.\n\n## The Framework That Actually Works\n\nLeading organizations transform post-mortems through three fundamental shifts:\n\n### Pillar 1: Psychological Safety Infrastructure\n\n**Design blamelessness into the process**: Focus on what went wrong in the system, not who to blame. Avoid language like \"Engineer X didn't follow procedure\" and instead phrase it as \"The procedure was unclear, and safeguards failed to catch the issue.\"\n\nLearn from Etsy's transparency model: Etsy implemented a \"Just Culture\" where engineers publicly share mistakes in company-wide emails so everyone can learn.[⁶](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-6) These emails describe what happened, why the engineer made their choices, and lessons learned, all without punishment. The result? A highly proactive culture where people aren't afraid to surface problems.\n\nEstablish ground rules before incidents happen: Set blamelessness expectations _before_ the next outage. Define a policy that incident reviews focus on what any reasonable person could learn, not on criticizing individuals. Make it part of engineer onboarding.\n\n### Pillar 2: Systems Thinking Over Person-Hunting\n\nShift from \"who\" to \"how\" questions: Instead of \"Why did Bob deploy a bug?\", ask \"What testing or review process failed such that a bug made it to production? What conditions led Bob to think it was okay?\"\n\n**Apply structured analysis frameworks**: Use techniques like \"5 Whys\" (asking \"Why did the system allow this?\" each time) or Fishbone diagrams to map contributing causes across categories. Look for systemic patterns: are multiple incidents related to similar issues?\n\nLearn from aviation's transformation: Aviation achieved 95%+ incident reporting rates by adopting a systemic, non-blame approach.[²²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-22) When people aren't punished for mistakes, they report problems freely, and the organization gets safer.\n\n### Pillar 3: Action Accountability That Sticks\n\nAssign clear ownership: Every action item gets assigned to an individual owner (with their agreement), not to a group. That person drives completion or escalates issues.\n\nSet realistic deadlines and SLOs: Small fixes get 2-week deadlines; bigger items might get 4-8 weeks with milestones. The goal isn't micro-management but ensuring improvements don't slip into \"someday.\"\n\nBuild tracking and reminder systems: Create lightweight tracking visible to engineering leads. Review open action items monthly. **High-performing teams treat closure rates as seriously as uptime metrics.**\n\nSecure executive buy-in: When senior leaders regularly read post-mortems and ask about follow-up status, it signals this work is truly important. Organizations where executives publicly recognize preventive fixes see higher completion rates.\n\n## Your 90-Day Implementation Roadmap\n\n### Month 1: Lay the Foundation\n\n- **Announce the initiative:** Leadership explains the shift to blameless post-mortems and why, citing data about preventable incidents.\n- **Establish clear ground rules:** Without explicit policies, teams default to blame when under pressure. When the next incident hits, stressed engineers need something concrete to point to that says \"we focus on systems, not people.\"\n> Don't have a blameless policy yet? Use this ready-to-implement framework: [Blameless Post-Mortem Policy](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Blameless-Post-Mortem-Policy-26e6edefd08e80dbbcffce0093471840).\n- **Choose a pilot incident:** Conduct one post-mortem using the new approach as a learning moment for the organization.\n- **Success metric:** Complete at least one blameless post-mortem where the team felt safe discussing mistakes openly.\n\n### Month 2: Establish the Process\n\n- **Standardize templates & tracking:** Consistent structure ensures teams capture the same quality of insights every time. Without a proven template, teams waste time reinventing formats instead of focusing on learning.\n> Need a battle-tested template? Use this free, ready-to-use framework: [Post-Mortem Template](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Incident-Postmortem-Template-Blameless-26e6edefd08e80c6829bfffe0e2293fe).\n- **Train on-call engineers:** Brief people on the new incident handling approach, emphasizing blameless investigation.\n- **Begin pattern spotting:** Look for connections between incidents to identify systemic issues requiring attention.\n- **Execute quick wins:** Complete 70% of action items from Month one's post-mortem to build credibility.\n- **Success metric:** 100% of significant incidents get blameless post-mortems; >85% of action items completed within their deadlines.\n\n### Month 3: Scale and Solidify\n\n- **Extend cross-team:** Share post-mortems between teams or in engineering all-hands for broader learning.\n- **Conduct a 3-month review:** Gather feedback and address concerns (template too long, poor attendance, etc.).\n- **Reinforce training:** Hold brown-bag sessions on running blameless post-mortems using real examples.\n- **Celebrate & normalize:** Publicly acknowledge improvements and people who contributed candid analysis.\n- **Success metric:** 15% reduction in repeat incidents; faster post-mortem completion; positive team feedback.\n\n## Quick Wins to Start Today\n\n1. **Add a \"Contributing Factors\" section** to your [post-mortem template](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Incident-Postmortem-Template-Blameless-26e6edefd08e80c6829bfffe0e2293fe) (plural, to expect multiple causes)\n2. **Include \"What went well\"** to reinforce that incidents are learning opportunities\n3. **Assign a dedicated facilitator** for each post-mortem to maintain blameless tone\n4. **Track action completion rates** as a key reliability metric\n5. **Create a learning channel** where people can share mistakes without judgment\n\n## The Business Case\n\nOrganizations implementing this framework see measurable returns within months:\n- 50% reduction in repeat incidents[¹²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-12)\n- 30% faster incident resolution[¹²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-12)\n- Lower on-call burnout and attrition[²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-2)\n- Improved customer trust through transparent improvement[¹⁸](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-18)\n\nThe investment is minimal, mostly time and cultural change, but the ROI is substantial when you consider that preventing even one major incident can save hundreds of thousands in downtime costs.\n\n## Your Next Step\n\nPick the next incident that occurs and commit to trying the blameless approach. When it happens, gather the team and explicitly say: \"We're doing this post-mortem differently; blameless, focused on system issues. Let's ask _what_ and _how_ instead of _why_ and _who_.\"\n\n> Need a quick reference?

Elite teams like Google, Netflix, and Atlassian have refined this into a proven four-phase playbook that spans from immediate incident response through ongoing improvement.\n\nThis isn't just about writing better reports. It's about creating a closed-loop system where every incident becomes fuel for making your systems more resilient.\n\n![A trail sign with four arrows pointing in different directions.](incident-dive5-phases.webp)\n\n## Phase 1: Immediate Response (0-48 hours) - Stabilize and Record\n\nThe first 48 hours after an incident are critical for both resolution and learning. What you do immediately sets up everything that follows.\n\n### Speed Matters: The 5-Minute Rule\n\nElite SRE teams mobilize response within minutes. **Aim to have your on-call engineer respond and assemble a response team within 5 minutes.** This quick engagement can cut downtime significantly: teams that wait 30+ minutes to respond invariably suffer longer MTTR.\n\nPrerequisites for speed:\n\n- Clear on-call rotations defined in advance\n- Incident commander role identified before incidents happen\n- Communication channels pre-established\n- Escalation procedures documented and practiced\n\n### Communication Cadence: The 15-20 Minute Update Rule\n\nDuring the incident, establish a rhythm for updates: even if nothing has changed. **Post an update every 15-20 minutes in your public Slack channel or bridge line**, even if it's just \"investigating still.\"\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n- Keeps everyone aligned and avoids confusion\n- Creates a timeline you can use later in the post-mortem\n- Prevents stakeholder anxiety and speculation\n- Enables responders to focus on resolution instead of fielding questions\n\nAs PagerDuty notes, building a communication strategy to update stakeholders enables on-call responders to spend more time resolving the incident.[²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-2)\n\n### Real-Time Logging: Facts First, Analysis Later\n\nAs the incident unfolds, **encourage responders to log key events and decisions**: time, action, outcome. Capture this either in a shared document or directly in Slack.\n\nUse blame-neutral language:\n\n- **Good:** \"18:42 - Deployment of version 1.2 initiated\"\n- **Bad:** \"Dev deployed bad code at 18:42\"\n\nGoogle's postmortem guide emphasizes factual timelines to anchor the investigation.[¹⁸](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-18) **Facts first, analysis later.**\n\n### The 48-Hour Draft Rule\n\nWhile the incident is fresh, get a draft post-mortem started within 48 hours. It doesn't need to be final, but document the basics:\n\n- Timeline of events\n- Impact assessment\n- Known contributing factors\n- Initial thoughts on root cause\n\nWhy 48 hours matters:\n\n- Fresh information is more accurate\n- Faster publication reassures stakeholders you're addressing issues\n- Prevents speculation from filling the information void\n- Memory degrades quickly: capture details while they're vivid\n\nGoogle and other best-in-class organizations often publish postmortems within 24-48 hours of an outage. A senior engineer at Google put it: the longer you wait, the more people fill the void with speculation, which \"seldom works in your favor.\"[¹⁸](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-18)\n\n## Phase 2: Deep Analysis (48 hours - 7 days) - Investigate Thoroughly\n\nOnce the fire is out and a preliminary document exists, invest time in deeper analysis before finalizing the report.\n\n### Multidisciplinary Review: Gather All Perspectives\n\nSchedule a post-mortem meeting within a week that includes people from all relevant areas: not just the directly involved engineers. Include QA, support, operations, and anyone else with insight.\n\nWhy diverse perspectives matter:\n\n- Operations might point out monitoring gaps\n- QA might note test cases that could catch similar issues\n- Support might reveal customer-facing symptoms that weren't obvious\n- Different viewpoints ensure nothing is missed\n\nThis is where psychological safety becomes crucial: **the facilitator must set a tone that all questions are welcome and it's a blameless discussion.**\n\n### \"5 Whys\" and Beyond: Systematic Root Cause Analysis\n\nUse structured techniques to get past surface symptoms:\n\n1. **Ask \"Why\" iteratively** until you uncover process or design flaws\n2. **Counter hindsight bias** by asking \"Could we realistically have detected X before? If not, why not?\"\n3. **Look for systemic patterns** by reviewing past incidents for similarities\n4. **Apply human factors analysis** examining documentation quality, training gaps, and environmental pressures\n\nPattern recognition example: Teams often discover that 3 different incidents all stemmed from similar configuration mistakes, pointing to a tooling deficiency that wouldn't be obvious from any single incident.\n\n**High-maturity organizations perform periodic incident trend analysis**: Google aggregates postmortems to spot common themes across products.[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5)\n\n### Human Factors Investigation\n\nDon't just focus on technical root causes. Investigate human and organizational factors:\n- Was the runbook misleading or incomplete?\n- Did alert fatigue cause warnings to be ignored?\n- Was the engineer new or under pressure?\n- Were procedures tested under realistic conditions?\n\nThese factors often point to training needs or process improvements that are just as important as technical fixes.\n\n### Peer Review and Validation\n\nBy day 5-7, have a solid understanding of what went wrong, documented in the post-mortem. Ensure the analysis is reviewed by senior engineers or managers: Google requires peer review of postmortems for completeness.[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5)\n\nReview checklist:\n\n- Did we get to the real root causes?\n- Are there deeper issues we haven't addressed?\n- Is the tone blameless and factual?\n- Are we missing any contributing factors?\n\n## Phase 3: Action Planning (Days 7-14) - Turn Insights into Improvements\n\nWith causes identified, decide what to do about them.\n\n### Brainstorm and Prioritize Actions\n\nThe post-mortem team brainstorms specific preventative or corrective actions for each root cause, then prioritizes them using a systematic approach:\n\nPrioritization methods:\n\n- Risk Priority Number (RPN): Severity × Occurrence × Detection difficulty\n- Simple High/Medium/Low based on impact judgment\n- 80/20 rule: Which 20% of fixes will prevent 80% of the risk?\n\nCategorize by effort:\n\n- **Quick wins** (add missing monitor, fix documentation): Next sprint\n- **Medium improvements** (enhance testing, tool upgrades): 4-8 weeks\n- **Long-term projects** (architecture changes): Break into phases\n\n### Assign Owners and Set Deadlines\n\nAs covered in the Action Accountability pillar, every action gets:\n- **Individual owner** (with their agreement)\n- **Target completion date** appropriate to scope\n- **Tracking** in your project management system\n\nSLO examples from Atlassian:[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10)\n\n- Priority 1 actions: 4-8 weeks depending on severity\n- Medium actions: 8-12 weeks with milestones\n- Large projects: Quarterly planning with phases\n\n### Resource Commitment for Big Changes\n\nSometimes fixes require significant resources: budget, staffing, or architecture changes. Phase 3 is when you escalate to leadership if needed.\n\nMake the business case:\n- Frame it as preventing similar costly outages\n- Use incident impact data (revenue loss, SLA penalties)\n- Show how investment in prevention pays off\n\n**Companies like Google and Amazon explicitly budget engineering time for post-incident improvements** as part of \"keeping the lights on.\"\n\n### Documentation and Communication\n\nDocument the action plan clearly in the post-mortem report with a table showing:\n- Action description\n- Owner\n- Due date\n- Current status\n\nAlso communicate the plan to stakeholders: \"We've identified 5 follow-up actions; two are already done, three will be completed by next month, and here's how they'll mitigate the risk.\"\n\n## Phase 4: Learning Integration (Ongoing) - Make Improvement Continuous\n\nThis phase institutionalizes the process so the organization continuously gets safer and more efficient.\n\n### Monthly Tracking and Review\n\nAt least once monthly, leadership should review open post-mortem actions. This could be:\n\n- A spreadsheet or Linear filter of \"all postmortem tickets not done\"\n- A 30-minute \"post-mortem review\" meeting where teams update on open items\n- Custom reporting showing overdue or stuck actions\n\nWhy regular review matters:\n\n- Creates gentle peer pressure to complete tasks\n- Allows raising blockers early\n- Prevents \"out of sight, out of mind\" problems\n- Demonstrates leadership commitment\n\n### Quarterly Trend Analysis\n\nEvery quarter, analyze trends across incidents:\n\n- **Categorize root causes:** How many due to deployments? Scaling issues?

But now you need to convince your CTO, VP of Engineering, or director: and they have concerns.\n\n_\"Won't this let people off the hook?\"_ _\"We don't have time for all these processes.\"_ _\"Our incidents are all unique anyway.\"_ These are rational concerns from leaders who need to balance multiple priorities and justify investments to their stakeholders.\n\nHere's how to address the most common executive objections with data, business cases, and scripts that secure leadership support for the transformation.\n\n![Ranger bear briefing hikers at a large trailhead map.](incident-dive6-leader.webp)\n\n## Objection 1: \"Won't a 'Blameless' Approach Make Engineers Less Accountable?\"\n\n### The Concern\n\nSome managers worry that if nobody gets blamed, people won't take incidents seriously or might become careless with their work.\n\n### The Reality-Based Response\n\n**Blameless post-mortems create MORE accountability, not less**: just a different kind. People become accountable for learning and improving systems rather than being shamed for individual failures.\n\n### Present the data:\n\n- Google and Etsy's experiences show engineers actually come forward and own up to mistakes more readily in blameless cultures[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5)[⁶](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-6)\n- Teams with psychological safety report 47% more errors: not because they make more mistakes, but because they surface issues that can be fixed[⁴](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-4)\n- In blame-driven cultures, people withhold information to avoid punishment, slowing resolution and hiding systemic problems[⁷](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-7)\n\n### Frame it correctly:\n\n\"We're not ignoring responsibility: we're clarifying it. Instead of responsibility to avoid blame, we're creating responsibility to improve the system. Performance issues are still handled through normal management channels, but **the post-mortem arena is for truth-finding, not disciplinary action.**\"\n\n### Address willful negligence:\n\n\"Any willful negligence or malicious acts would be handled outside the normal post-mortem process through HR and performance management. But those cases are exceedingly rare in professional environments. Most incidents are system problems or unintentional mistakes that blame won't prevent.\"\n\n### The Business Case Script\n\n\"The goal is faster incident resolution and fewer repeat outages. When people freely share information instead of hiding it, we resolve incidents faster and prevent similar ones. **Google's internal data shows that teams with blameless cultures suffer fewer outages and deliver better user experiences.**[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5) We're optimizing for business outcomes, not individual punishment.\"\n\n## Objection 2: \"We Don't Have Time for All These Follow-Ups and Meetings\"\n\n### The Concern\n\nTeams are busy with product deadlines, and managers fear the overhead of thorough post-mortems will slow down feature delivery.\n\n### The Math-Based Response\n\n#### Present the cost comparison:\n\n- Gartner estimates downtime costs approximately $5,600 per minute (~$300k per hour)[¹³](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-13)\n- A single major incident can cost more than months of engineering time\n- Preventing one outage through systematic fixes typically pays for the entire program\n\n#### Show the efficiency gains:\n\n- Post-mortems don't have to be long meetings (30 minutes if well-prepared)\n- Standard post-mortem write-ups take only 1-2 hours of work spread across multiple people\n- Much of the process integrates with existing workflows\n- Teams that get good at this process actually save time by preventing firefighting\n\n#### Address the investment mindset:\n\n\"This is a classic pay-now or pay-later scenario. We can invest a few hours systematically improving our systems, or we can spend dozens of hours firefighting the same issues repeatedly. **Companies implementing systematic post-incident improvements see up to 50% fewer repeat incidents.**[¹²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-12)\"\n\n### The ROI Script\n\n\"Let's look at our last major outage: 4 hours of downtime, 8 engineers involved in resolution, customer impact, potential SLA penalties. That's easily $200k+ in direct costs, not counting reputation damage. If a systematic post-mortem process prevents just one similar incident per year, it pays for itself many times over.\"\n\n## Objection 3: \"Our Incidents Are All Unique; Is It Worth Standardizing This Much?\"\n\n### The Concern\n\nA lead might argue that every outage is different and case-by-case handling is more appropriate than a rigid process.\n\n### The Pattern-Recognition Response\n\n#### Share the research:\n\nWhile every incident has unique aspects, studies show common failure patterns across organizations. A 2024 study found 80% of incidents stem from internal changes, and 69% lack proactive alerts.[¹](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-1) These are systemic patterns that standardized analysis can catch.\n\n#### Explain the template value:\n\n\"A flexible template actually helps with unique incidents because it prompts us to consider areas we might otherwise ignore in the heat of the moment. **Even unique incidents have contributing factors we should examine systematically.**\"\n\n#### Highlight cross-team benefits:\n\n\"Standardization allows knowledge sharing across teams. When everyone uses a similar format, it's easier to read each other's reports and learn from different teams' experiences. Companies like Atlassian and Amazon standardized postmortem templates precisely so lessons could be consumed company-wide.\"[¹⁰](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-10)\n\n### The Consistency Script\n\n\"Think of it like surgeons using a pre-surgery checklist. Yes, every surgery is unique, but the checklist dramatically reduces errors by ensuring critical steps aren't missed. We can always adapt the process as we learn, but having no standard process means we'll miss important factors when we're under pressure.\"\n\n## Objection 4: \"What If an Engineer Truly Violated Best Practices? No Accountability at All?\"\n\n### The Concern\n\nDirectors wonder if someone does something reckless, do they just get away with it in a blameless world?\n\n### The Separation Response\n\n#### Clarify the distinction:\n\n\"Blameless post-mortem doesn't mean no accountability ever: it means the analysis process is separate from discipline. If someone ignored protocol or did something against known rules, that's a performance/HR issue handled by their manager privately.\"\n\n#### Explain why mixing hurts:\n\n\"If we mix investigation and discipline, others become less forthcoming. You can **handle performance issues separately while keeping the incident analysis focused on system improvement.**\"\n\n#### Reference industry standards:\n\n\"We follow a 'just culture' approach from aviation and healthcare: console human error, coach at-risk behavior, and only discipline reckless behavior.[²²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-22) Most incidents are system problems or unintentional mistakes. **True recklessness is extremely rare**, maybe 1% of cases.\"\n\n### The Professionalism Script\n\n\"In practice, clear protocols and training reduce negligent errors to near-zero. Most incidents involve reasonable people making reasonable decisions with incomplete information. If we ever have truly egregious behavior like someone being intoxicated on call, that's handled through normal disciplinary channels, not in the post-mortem meeting.\"\n\n## Objection 5: \"Will This Really Improve Uptime and Customer Trust?\"\n\n### The Concern\n\nExecutives need tangible business outcomes, not just internal process improvements.\n\n### The Data-Driven Response\n\n#### Present the reliability connection:\n\n\"Yes: research shows a direct link to reliability and customer satisfaction. Organizations implementing systematic post-incident improvements see up to 50% fewer repeat incidents and 30% faster resolution times.\"[¹²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-12)\n\n#### Show competitive advantage:\n\n\"Google's and Amazon's high availability is partly due to their incident learning processes. Many enterprises now require vendors to demonstrate mature incident response programs in RFPs. This makes us more competitive.\"\n\n#### Highlight customer trust benefits:\n\n\"When companies like Cloudflare or Stripe publish detailed outage analyses, customers respond positively. It builds trust that we're competent and honest rather than trying to hide problems.\"\n\n### The Business Impact Script\n\n\"By preventing repeat incidents and reducing MTTR, we increase uptime and SLA compliance, reducing customer churn. Internally, less firefighting means more time for features. And transparent incident handling often improves customer relationships: they appreciate honest communication about improvements.\"\n\n## Getting Executive Buy-In: The Implementation Approach\n\n### Start Small, Show Results\n\n1. **Pilot with one significant incident** using the new approach\n2. **Document the differences** in findings and team feedback\n3. **Show concrete action items** that wouldn't have emerged from traditional blame-focused analysis\n4. **Track and report outcomes** from implemented fixes\n\n### Make It About Business Outcomes\n\nFrame every conversation in terms of:\n- Reduced downtime costs\n- Improved customer satisfaction\n- Better engineering retention\n- Competitive advantage\n- Risk mitigation\n\n### Provide Clear Success Metrics\n\nOffer to track and report on:\n\n- Repeat incident rate reduction\n- Mean time to resolution improvement\n- Action item completion rates\n- Team satisfaction with incident process\n- Customer trust metrics\n\n### Address Resource Needs Proactively\n\n\"This requires minimal additional resources: mostly time reallocation and process changes. The main investment is in facilitating meetings and tracking follow-ups. Most companies implement this with existing staff.\"\n\n## Sample Executive Presentation Outline\n\n### Slide 1: The Problem\n\n\"80% of our incidents are preventable, but we're caught in a blame-repeat cycle\"\n\n### Slide 2: The Cost\n\n\"Last quarter: X hours of downtime, $Y in estimated costs, Z repeat incidents\"\n\n### Slide 3: The Solution\n\n\"Three pillars: Safety, Systems Thinking, Accountability\"\n\n### Slide 4: The ROI\n\n\"50% fewer repeat incidents, 30% faster resolution, improved retention\"\n\n### Slide 5: The Ask\n\n\"Support for 90-day pilot with clear success metrics\"\n\n## Common Executive Responses and Rebuttals\n\n\"This sounds like a lot of overhead\"\n\n→ \"It's less overhead than repeatedly fixing the same problems. The time investment is front-loaded but pays dividends.\"\n\n\"How do I know teams will actually follow this?\"\n\n→ \"We'll track completion rates and team feedback. Early wins build momentum for broader adoption.\"\n\n\"What if it doesn't work for our culture?\"\n\n→ \"We'll start with a pilot and adapt based on what we learn. The principles are proven across many industries.\"\n\n## Your Leadership Conversation Script\n\n\"I'd like to propose an improvement to our incident management process that could significantly reduce our repeat outages and engineering firefighting time.\n\nCurrently, we're seeing _[specific recent examples]_ where similar incidents recur because we're not systematically addressing root causes. Industry research shows this is common: most organizations fix symptoms rather than systems.\n\nI'd like to pilot a proven framework used by Google, Netflix, and other leading tech companies. It focuses on three areas: psychological safety so people share complete information, systems thinking to find real root causes, and action accountability to ensure fixes actually happen.\n\nThe business impact is significant: organizations implementing this see 50% fewer repeat incidents and 30% faster resolution times. Given our current downtime costs, preventing even one major repeat incident would justify the investment.\n\nI'm proposing a 90-day pilot where we track specific metrics like repeat incident rates and action completion. If it works, we scale it. If not, we've learned something valuable with minimal risk.\n\nCan I get your support to try this approach on our next significant incident?\"\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nMost executive resistance comes from understandable concerns about accountability, time, and ROI. By addressing these concerns with data, industry examples, and clear business outcomes, you can build the case for systematic incident learning.\n\nRemember: **you're not asking for a leap of faith. You're proposing a proven approach with measurable outcomes and a clear pilot structure.** Focus on business results, provide concrete metrics, and start small to build momentum.\n\n---\n\n> **Want the definitive implementation framework?** Read the [Definitive Guide](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide) for detailed success stories, cultural transformation roadmaps, and templates for measuring business impact.\n\n---\n\n### Complete the series:\n\n- [The Reality Check](/articles/post-mortem-reality-check) - Why incidents repeat and how elite teams break the cycle\n- [Psychological Safety Infrastructure](/articles/post-mortem-psychological-safety) - Building blame-free cultures\n- [Systems Thinking Over Person-Hunting](/articles/post-mortem-systems-thinking) - Finding real root causes\n- [Action Accountability That Sticks](/articles/post-mortem-action-accountability) - Ensuring improvements happen\n- [Four-Phase Implementation Playbook](/articles/post-mortem-implementation-playbook) - Tactical execution guide\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- Definitive Guide (60 min) – canonical reference\n  - https://www.benjamincharity.com/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide","src/content/blog/post-mortem-leadership-buy-in.mdx","4e688b9da8013d4a","post-mortem-psychological-safety",{"id":442,"data":444,"body":450,"filePath":451,"digest":452,"deferredRender":27},{"title":445,"date":446,"tags":447,"description":448,"image":449,"draft":22,"readingTime":23},"Effective Post-Mortems: Psychological Safety",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.234Z"],[244,17,132],"Design blamelessness into your incident process so teams surface truth instead of hiding mistakes.","incident-dive2-lantern.webp","> **This is part of the Post-Mortem series.** Read the [Executive Brief](/articles/post-mortem-executive-brief) (7 min), the [Field Guide](/articles/post-mortem-field-guide) (20 min), or the [Definitive Guide](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide) (60 min, canonical).\n\n![Ranger bear listening as another ranger speaks in a safe group circle.](incident-dive2-lantern.webp)\n\n## You Can't Fix What People Are Afraid to Say\n\nWhen engineers fear blame, the whole post-mortem process becomes a superficial exercise. Important details get hidden, critical mistakes go unmentioned, and the real causes of incidents stay buried. The result? Organizations repeat the same failures over and over because they never learn the full truth about what went wrong.\n\nBut teams that create genuine psychological safety see dramatically different outcomes. They uncover root causes faster, implement more effective fixes, and experience far fewer repeat incidents. The difference isn't in their technical sophistication: it's in their willingness to surface uncomfortable truths.\n\n## The Research: Why Safety Drives Performance\n\nGoogle's famous \"Project Aristotle\" research analyzed 180 teams to understand what made some high-performing and others mediocre. The #1 predictor wasn't technical expertise, individual talent, or team composition. It was **psychological safety**: the shared belief that team members can admit mistakes, ask questions, and voice concerns without fear of punishment or embarrassment.[³](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-3)\n\nThis finding has been replicated across industries. Amy Edmondson's foundational research in healthcare teams found that high-safety teams reported significantly more errors than low-safety teams. Not because they made more mistakes, but because they felt safe admitting them.[⁴](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-4) Those error reports led to system improvements that prevented future failures.\n\n### The Paradox of Error Reporting\n\nIn psychologically safe environments, people consistently report higher error rates. This initially seems counterintuitive (shouldn't better teams make fewer mistakes? But the data reveals the opposite) **high-performing teams surface problems early**, while blame-driven cultures drive issues underground.\n\nConsider two scenarios:\n- **Team A (Low Safety):** Engineer notices a concerning metric but doesn't mention it because \"it's probably nothing\" and they don't want to look paranoid.\n- **Team B (High Safety):** Engineer immediately flags the same concern, leading to investigation that prevents a major outage.\n\nThe difference isn't in what happens: it's in what gets shared. Team B prevents more incidents because they surface more potential problems.\n\n## The Cost of Fear\n\nWhen post-mortems feel like witch hunts, organizations pay multiple costs:\n\n### Information Warfare\n\nPeople hide or downplay crucial facts to avoid embarrassment. During outages, this is disastrous: if engineers hesitate to report mistakes, recovery is delayed and root causes stay hidden. Google's SRE guide warns: **\"An atmosphere of blame risks creating a culture in which incidents and issues are swept under the rug,\"** increasing organizational risk.[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5)\n\n### Brain Drain\n\nTalented engineers don't stick around in blame-heavy cultures. They know that in complex systems, everyone makes mistakes eventually. If the organizational response is to find someone to punish, they'll find somewhere else to work.\n\n### Innovation Paralysis\n\nWhen failure means blame, people avoid taking risks. This creates a culture of CYA (Cover Your Assets) rather than bold problem-solving. Teams spend more energy protecting themselves than improving systems.\n\n## How Elite Teams Build Safety Infrastructure\n\nLeading organizations don't just hope for psychological safety: they design it into their processes. Here's how:\n\n### Design Blamelessness Into the Process\n\nThe post-mortem process and report should focus on what went wrong in the system, not who to blame. This isn't just about tone: it's about structure:\n\n- **Instead of:** \"Engineer X didn't follow procedure\"\n- **Use:** \"The procedure was unclear, and safeguards failed to catch the issue\"\n\n- **Instead of:** \"Why did you make that decision?\"\n- **Use:** \"What information was available when that decision was made?\"\n\nLanguage shapes thinking. **By consistently framing problems as system issues rather than personal failures, you train people to think in terms of improvement rather than blame.**\n\n### Learn from Etsy's Transparency Model\n\nEtsy famously implemented a \"Just Culture\" where engineers publicly share their mistakes in company-wide emails so everyone can learn.[⁶](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-6) These \"PSA\" emails describe what happened, why the engineer made the choices they did, and what they learned: all without punishment.\n\nThe CEO and CTO openly endorse this practice. As Etsy's CTO John Allspaw put it, a funny thing happens when engineers feel safe to give details about mistakes: they actually become more accountable, and the whole company gets better.[⁶](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-6)\n\nThe key elements of Etsy's approach:\n- **Public sharing** normalizes discussing mistakes\n- **Focus on learning** rather than blame\n- **Executive support** signals organizational commitment\n- **No punishment** reinforces psychological safety\n\n### Establish Ground Rules Before Incidents Happen\n\nDon't wait for the next outage to introduce blameless principles. Set expectations proactively:\n\n1. **Create a written policy** approved by leadership stating that incident reviews focus on learning, not punishment\n2. **Include it in onboarding** so new engineers understand the culture from day one\n3. **Reinforce during incidents** with reminders like \"This is a blameless investigation: all facts are welcome\"\n4. **Model the behavior** by having leaders share their own mistakes and learnings\n\n### Track Safety Over Time\n\nCultural change needs measurement. Consider adding brief surveys after post-mortems or periodic team health checks with questions like:\n- \"When someone makes a mistake on this team, it is not held against them\"\n- \"I feel safe admitting errors to my teammates\"\n- \"Our incident reviews focus on system improvement rather than individual blame\"\n\nTrack these scores over time and aim for improvement. High reporting of mistakes is actually a positive indicator, as long as you're learning from them.\n\n## Practical Implementation Steps\n\n### Week 1: Set the Foundation\n- Draft a blameless post-mortem policy with executive sign-off\n- Communicate the new approach in team meetings\n- Choose facilitators who understand and can model blameless investigation\n\n### Week 2-4: Practice and Reinforce\n- Apply the approach to the next incident (even a minor one)\n- Use language that focuses on system conditions rather than individual actions\n- Celebrate when people share mistakes or near-misses\n\n### Month 2-3: Build Habits\n- Create channels for sharing learnings and near-misses\n- Recognize people who contribute honest, detailed post-mortem insights\n- Address any backsliding into blame language immediately\n\n### Ongoing: Maintain and Improve\n- Regular check-ins on psychological safety metrics\n- Continued executive modeling of blameless principles\n- Adjustment of processes based on team feedback\n\n## The Business Impact\n\nOrganizations that successfully build psychological safety infrastructure see measurable benefits:\n\n- **Fewer outages:** Google's internal data shows teams with blameless cultures suffer fewer incidents and deliver better user experiences[⁵](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-5)\n- **Faster resolution:** When people freely share information, incidents are resolved more quickly\n- **Better retention:** Engineers stay longer in cultures where mistakes are learning opportunities rather than career threats[²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-2)\n- **More innovation:** Teams willing to take calculated risks drive more breakthrough improvements\n\n## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\n\n### \"Blameless Means No Accountability\"\n\nSome managers worry that removing blame means removing consequences. In reality, blameless post-mortems create *more* accountability: just focused on learning and system improvement rather than punishment. Performance issues are handled separately through normal management channels.\n\n### \"We'll Become Careless\"\n\nThe opposite typically happens. When people aren't afraid to report problems, issues get caught and fixed earlier. Etsy's engineers report more mistakes after implementing their Just Culture, but they also prevent more outages.\n\n### \"One Incident Won't Change Culture\"\n\nStart small but be consistent.

We want to find the one person or one decision that \"caused\" the problem. But in complex systems like our production environments, **failures are almost never due to one person or one glitch in isolation**: they result from multiple contributing factors aligning perfectly.\n\nIt's like Swiss cheese: each slice has holes, but you only see through when several holes line up. Similarly, most incidents require multiple things to go wrong simultaneously. A code bug _and_ a missing alert _and_ a slow rollback procedure _and_ unclear documentation all conspire together.\n\nIf we only blame the engineer who pushed the code, we miss the other three factors that made the incident possible - and inevitable.\n\n![A fallen tree blocking a forest trail.](incident-dive3-tree-down.webp)\n\n## The Trap of Human Nature\n\nEven veteran incident investigators fall into predictable cognitive traps:\n\n### Hindsight Bias Makes Everything \"Obvious\"\n\nAfter an incident, it's human nature to ask \"who missed the warning signs?\" and \"how did we not see this coming?\" This falls victim to hindsight bias: the tendency for past events to seem more predictable than they actually were.\n\nOnce we know the outcome, we conclude we \"should have known\" things that were actually unknowable beforehand. This makes us judge decisions based on their outcomes rather than the information available when they were made.\n\n### Confirmation Bias Seeks Easy Answers\n\nStudies show that even experienced investigators can be led astray by their preconceived theories. They seek evidence to fit a favorite hypothesis and overlook contrary facts.[⁹](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-9) In practice, this means a post-mortem might pin the cause on an easy scapegoat when reality involves multiple contributing factors.\n\nDave Zwieback points out that **hindsight and blame create a \"comfortable story\" that satisfies our need for closure but prevents real learning**.[⁷](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-7) We prematurely decide \"Susan deployed bad code, that's the root cause,\" and stop analyzing deeper systemic issues.\n\n### The Fundamental Attribution Error\n\nWhen something goes wrong, we tend to attribute others' actions to their character (\"Bob is careless\") while attributing our own actions to circumstances (\"I was under pressure\"). This bias leads us to focus on individual traits rather than the contextual factors that influenced behavior.\n\n## The Systems Thinking Alternative\n\nLeading organizations shift their analysis from \"who\" to \"how\" by examining the system of conditions that made failure possible:\n\n### Ask Better Questions\n\nTransform your incident investigation language:\n\n- **Instead of:** \"Why did Bob deploy a bug on Friday?\" **Ask:** \"What testing or review process failed such that a bug made it to production? What pressures or assumptions led Bob to think deployment was safe?\"\n- **Instead of:** \"Who missed the alert?\" **Ask:** \"How could our alerting system be designed so critical issues are impossible to miss?\"\n- **Instead of:** \"Why didn't Sarah follow the runbook?\" **Ask:** \"What made the runbook difficult to follow? How could we make the correct path the easy path?\"\n\nThis shift reveals systemic fixes rather than individual blame.\n\n### Apply Structured Analysis Frameworks\n\nUse proven techniques to systematically explore contributing factors:\n\n#### The \"5 Whys\" with a Twist\n\nTraditional 5 Whys asks \"Why did this happen?\" five times. Systems-focused 5 Whys asks \"Why did the _system_ allow this to happen?\" each time:\n\n1. **Why did the database timeout?** - The connection pool was exhausted\n2. **Why did the system allow the connection pool to be exhausted?** - No monitoring alerts fired\n3. **Why did the system allow alerts to not fire?** - The threshold was set too high\n4. **Why did the system allow incorrect thresholds?** - No process for validating alert configurations\n5. **Why did the system allow missing validation processes?** - No ownership model for infrastructure reliability\n\nEach \"why\" reveals a layer of systemic opportunity for improvement.\n\n#### Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagrams\n\nMap contributing causes across categories:\n- **Human factors:** Was someone new? Under pressure? Missing training?\n- **Process issues:** Were procedures unclear? Missing steps? Conflicting guidance?\n- **Technology problems:** Tool failures? Missing capabilities? Poor interfaces?\n- **Environmental factors:** Time pressure? Resource constraints? External dependencies?\n\nThis structured approach ensures you don't miss entire categories of contributing factors.\n\n### Examine Human Factors as System Issues\n\nWhen someone makes a mistake, resist the urge to focus on their individual failings. Instead, examine the conditions that made the mistake possible:\n\n- Was documentation misleading or incomplete?\n- Did alert fatigue cause an alarm to be ignored?\n- Was the engineer new to this system or under time pressure?\n- Were procedures tested under realistic conditions?\n- Did tooling make the wrong action easy and the right action difficult?\n\nAs Dave Zwieback puts it: **\"Human error is a symptom, never the cause, of deeper trouble in the system.\"**[⁷](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-7) If someone made a mistake, ask what made that mistake possible and how the system could catch or prevent it.\n\n## Learning from Aviation's Transformation\n\nThe aviation industry provides a powerful example of systems thinking in action. Aviation achieved a 95%+ incident reporting rate and dramatically reduced accidents by adopting a systemic, non-blame approach.[²²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-22)\n\nThrough programs like NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System, pilots receive immunity when they voluntarily report errors or near-misses. This created an enormous database of systemic issues and fixes. The result: aviation's fatal accident rate kept dropping despite increasing complexity.[²²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-22)\n\nThe key insight: **When people aren't punished for mistakes, they report problems freely, and the organization as a whole gets safer.** Nearly all incidents get reported, providing a rich dataset for systematic improvement.\n\n## Practical Systems Analysis Techniques\n\n### Look for Patterns Across Incidents\n\nDon't analyze incidents in isolation. Review past incidents to identify systemic trends:\n\n- Are multiple incidents related to the same microservice?\n- Do several outages stem from similar configuration mistakes?\n- Is there a pattern of incidents happening at specific times or under specific conditions?\n\nPattern recognition reveals system-level weaknesses that might not be obvious from single incidents.\n\n### Include Multiple Perspectives\n\nGather input from all relevant areas during post-mortem discussions:\n- **Operations** might spot monitoring gaps\n- **QA** might note missing test cases\n- **Support** might reveal customer-facing symptoms that weren't obvious\n- **Security** might identify broader vulnerability patterns\n\nDifferent perspectives ensure nothing gets missed and reveal the full system context.\n\n### Document Alternative Hypotheses\n\nForce yourself to consider multiple possible explanations:\n- What other factors could have contributed?\n- What nearly went right that prevented worse outcomes?\n- What assumptions are we making that might be wrong?\n\nThis counteracts the tendency to settle on the first plausible explanation.\n\n## Common Systems Thinking Mistakes\n\n### Stopping at the First Reasonable Cause\n\nJust because you found *a* cause doesn't mean you found *all* the causes. Complex incidents typically have 3-4 significant contributing factors. Keep digging until you understand the full system context.\n\n### Focusing Only on Technical Factors\n\nRemember to examine organizational, process, and human factors alongside technical ones. Often the most impactful fixes involve clarifying procedures, improving training, or adjusting team structures.\n\n### Making Fixes Too Specific\n\nIf your incident was caused by \"missing validation in the user registration service,\" don't just add validation to that one service. Ask: \"How many other services have similar validation gaps? **How do we prevent this class of problem systematically?**\"\n\n## The Business Value of Systems Thinking\n\nOrganizations that adopt systems thinking in incident analysis see multiple benefits:\n\n### Prevents Entire Classes of Incidents\n\nInstead of fixing one specific bug, you fix the conditions that allow similar bugs to reach production. This dramatically reduces repeat incidents.\n\n### Improves Team Morale\n\nEngineers appreciate analyses that focus on improving systems rather than assigning blame. This leads to better retention and more willing participation in incident reviews.\n\n### Builds Antifragile Systems\n\nBy understanding how failures propagate through your system, you can design resilience that actually improves under stress. Companies like Netflix have embraced this through chaos engineering.[¹⁷](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-17)\n\n## Your Implementation Checklist\n\n1. **Modify your [post-mortem template](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Incident-Postmortem-Template-Blameless-26e6edefd08e80c6829bfffe0e2293fe)** to include a \"Contributing Factors\" section (plural)\n2. **Train facilitators** to ask \"how\" and \"what\" questions instead of \"who\" and \"why\"\n3. **Include \"What went well\" sections** to balance the analysis\n4. **Require multiple perspectives** in every significant incident review\n5. **Look for patterns** across incidents rather than treating each as isolated\n\n### Continue the series:\n\n- [Action Accountability That Sticks](/articles/post-mortem-action-accountability) - Ensuring your systemic insights lead to actual improvements\n- [Four-Phase Implementation Playbook](/articles/post-mortem-implementation-playbook) - A structured approach to rollout\n\n---\n\n> **Want the definitive framework?** Read the [Definitive Guide](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide) for detailed implementation steps, aviation case studies, and structured analysis templates.\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- Definitive Guide (60 min) – canonical reference\n  - https://www.benjamincharity.com/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide\n- [Post-Mortem Cheat Sheet](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Post-Mortem-Cheat-Sheet-27b6edefd08e807ab127d93c09411e63) – free quick-reference checklist\n- [Post-Mortem Template](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Incident-Postmortem-Template-Blameless-26e6edefd08e80c6829bfffe0e2293fe) – free, ready-to-use Notion template\n- [Blameless Post-Mortem Policy](https://benjamincharity.notion.site/Blameless-Post-Mortem-Policy-26e6edefd08e80dbbcffce0093471840) – ready-to-implement blameless policy framework","src/content/blog/post-mortem-systems-thinking.mdx","fe93c1f2cf074ac5","post-mortem-reality-check",{"id":478,"data":480,"body":487,"filePath":488,"digest":489,"deferredRender":27},{"title":481,"date":482,"tags":483,"description":485,"image":486,"draft":22,"readingTime":109},"Effective Post-Mortems: Reality Check",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.235Z"],[244,17,472,484],"reliability","Why incidents repeat and how elite teams break the cycle with proactive alerts and systemic fixes.","incident-dive1-no-fires.webp","> **This is part of the Post-Mortem series.** Read the [Executive Brief](/articles/post-mortem-executive-brief) (7 min), the [Field Guide](/articles/post-mortem-field-guide) (20 min), or the [Definitive Guide](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide) (60 min, canonical).\n\n![Abandoned campfire pit with smoke rising and a warning sign.](incident-dive1-no-fires.webp)\n\n## The Recurring Nightmare\n\nA director explained the same database timeout issue for the third time in six months. Each incident write-up blamed a different team member, but the root cause never changed. No systemic fixes followed, so the outages kept happening.\n\nThis isn't a rare story; it's common when post-mortems are treated as a formality or finger-pointing exercise. Most organizations do create post-mortem reports after big incidents, but they skip the hard work of systemic change. The result: the same failures repeat.\n\n## The Brutal Data\n\nHere's what empirical research tells us about why incidents happen and keep happening:\n\n### 80% Are Self-Inflicted\n\nA 2024 study of 26 major fintech incidents found that **80% of incidents stemmed from internal changes**: deployments, config updates, and other modifications that weren't tested or controlled properly.[¹](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-1) In other words, most outages aren't caused by external forces or unforeseeable circumstances. They're self-inflicted wounds from our own actions.\n\n### 69% Lack Early Warning\n\nThe same study showed **69% of incidents lacked proactive alerts**, meaning teams only discovered the problem after damage was done.[¹](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-1) These weren't subtle, hard-to-detect issues. They were problems that could have been caught if proper monitoring and alerting systems were in place.\n\n### Most Learning Efforts Fail\n\nDespite formal incident processes, recurring IT incidents persist across most organizations. This indicates that teams aren't truly learning or improving systems; they're going through the motions without addressing underlying causes.\n\n## The Elite vs. Average Divide\n\nThe gap between average and elite teams is enormous when it comes to incident management:\n\n### Elite Teams: The Prevention Masters\n\nHigh-performing organizations virtually eliminate repeat failures. In top \"Site Reliability Engineering\" cultures, major incidents rarely recur. Companies with continuous learning cultures (blameless post-mortems, proactive fixes) experience far fewer customer-impacting incidents than their peers.[²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-2)\n\n**Elite teams prevent ~95% of repeat incidents.** When they have an outage, they systematically address not just the immediate cause but the conditions that allowed it to happen. They ask: \"What other ways could this type of failure occur?\" and \"How do we prevent the entire class of similar incidents?\"\n\n### Average Teams: The Blame Cycle\n\nMost teams get stuck in a reactive pattern:\n1. Incident happens\n2. Someone gets blamed\n3. Surface-level fix applied\n4. Same type of incident happens again\n5. Different person gets blamed\n6. Cycle repeats\n\nMeanwhile, average teams remain reactive. They treat each incident as an isolated event rather than a symptom of systemic issues. Their post-mortems focus on \"who\" rather than \"how,\" missing opportunities for meaningful improvement.\n\n## The Hidden Organizational Costs\n\nThe cost of this repetitive cycle extends beyond immediate downtime:\n\n### Financial Impact\n- Gartner estimates downtime costs ~$5,600 per minute on average[¹³](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-13)\n- For high-traffic services, costs can reach hundreds of thousands per hour\n- Preventing even one repeat incident can far outweigh the engineering effort needed\n\n### Human Impact\n- Engineers suffer from firefighting fatigue\n- On-call burnout increases with repeated incidents\n- Organizations with poor incident practices have 21% higher attrition[²](/articles/post-mortem-definitive-guide#user-content-fn-2)\n- Talent chooses to work where they won't constantly fight the same fires\n\n### Opportunity Cost\n- Engineering time spent on repeat incidents can't be spent on innovation\n- Teams in blame cycles focus on covering themselves rather than improving systems\n- Competitive advantage erodes when engineering capacity is consumed by preventable problems\n\n## Why Smart Teams Get Stuck\n\nEven intelligent, well-intentioned teams fall into this trap. Three factors create the repetitive incident cycle:\n\n### The Blame Reflex\n\nWhen something goes wrong, human nature seeks someone to hold responsible. This satisfies our need for closure but prevents deep analysis. We stop investigating once we find a scapegoat, missing the systemic factors that made the failure possible.\n\n### Hindsight Bias\n\nAfter an incident, everything seems obvious. We think \"we should have known\" things that were actually unknowable beforehand. This false clarity leads to shallow fixes focused on individual awareness rather than system design.\n\n### The Action Item Void\n\nEven when good insights emerge, execution often fails. Without clear ownership and tracking, follow-up tasks disappear into backlogs. Teams move on to new work, and the underlying vulnerabilities remain.\n\n## The Path Forward\n\nThe good news? This cycle isn't inevitable.

Creating an environment\nthat fosters focus, efficiency, and comfort is essential to navigate these\nchallenges effectively. This article outlines practical strategies for remote\nworkers to enhance their work-from-home experience.\n\n![A serene, well-lit home office setup with a standing desk, laptop, headphones, desk lamp, and an indoor plant, highlighting an efficient and comfortable remote work environment.](home_office_in_light.webp)\n\n## 1. Optimal Communication: The Role of Headphones\n\nUsing headphones during virtual meetings is more than a convenience; it's a\nnecessity for clear communication. **Without headphones, computers and software\nmust constantly adjust input volumes to minimize background noise, often causing\ninterruptions and challenging conversations.** Headphones eliminate this issue\nby ensuring your microphone only picks up your voice, thus preventing the\nawkward overlaps of people talking over each other.\n\nInvestment: $30-300\n\nTools: Any headphones. Bonus for Active Noise Canceling (ANC).\n\n## 2. Lighting: A Key to Clarity and Comfort\n\nGood lighting transcends essential utility in the remote work setup; it is\npivotal for video calls and personal workspace illumination. The proper lighting\nsetup ensures you are visible during virtual meetings, avoiding the common\nproblem of a shadowed face, which can detract from engagement and communication\neffectiveness. **It’s not just about being seen; it’s about ensuring that others\ncan read your non-verbal cues as clearly as if you were in the same room.**\n\nFor video calls, consider investing in personal lighting solutions such as a\nring light or a simple desk lamp positioned to cast even light across your face.\nThis setup helps eliminate shadows and improves the overall video quality,\nmaking interactions more personal and engaging.\n\nMoreover, the choice of lighting in your workspace can significantly impact your\ncomfort and productivity. While direct lighting can be harsh for many, opting\nfor softer, natural light sources can help maintain alertness and reduce eye\nstrain without causing discomfort. For those times when natural light is\ninsufficient, LED lamps with adjustable brightness and color temperature can\nmimic natural light, offering a balanced environment that supports sustained\nfocus and well-being.\n\nInvestment: $20-$275\n\nTools: clip-on light for laptop, dedicated lights for workstation.\n\n## 3. Visual Engagement: The Importance of an External Camera\n\nAn external camera can dramatically enhance your presence in virtual meetings.\n**When participants use their laptop's camera while looking at an external\nmonitor, it can appear as if they're disengaged.** An external camera at eye\nlevel fosters a more direct and engaging interaction.\n\nInvestment: $30-$250\n\nTools: Webcam, camera, conference call solution\n\n## 4. Time Management: The Pomodoro Technique\n\nThe Pomodoro timer, a tool for managing work intervals with short breaks, can\nsignificantly boost productivity. Workers can maintain high concentration levels\nby breaking work into focused segments while ensuring regular rest.\n\nInvestment: free-$35\n\nTools: Digital or physical timer\n\n## 5. Boundaries at Home: The On-Call Light\n\nMaintaining a clear boundary between personal and professional life can be\ndifficult when working from home. In this regard, the on-call light can be a\ngame-changer. This device serves as a visual signal, indicating to your family\nmembers when you are on an important call or engrossed in work. It can help\nreduce interruptions and convey your availability without verbal communication.\n\nBy incorporating an on-call light into your home office setup, you can send a\nclear message to your family that when you work from home, **you are still in a\nprofessional environment and require the same respect as you would in a physical\noffice**. It is a simple yet powerful tool that can help bridge the gap between\nflexible remote work and the need for uninterrupted focus.\n\nInvestment: $20-$50\n\nTools: Luxafor, Busylight\n\n## 6. Rituals for Mindset Transition\n\nStarting your day with intention can transform how you approach work from home.\nImagine brewing an exceptional coffee or tea as a meaningful transition into\nyour professional self rather than just a morning treat. This simple act serves\nas a psychological threshold, bridging the gap between personal leisure and work\ntime and preparing you mentally for the day ahead. It's about setting a tone of\nmindfulness and purpose from the moment you wake up, signaling your brain that\nit's time to focus and engage with your tasks.\n\nTo add depth to this routine, consider the practice of writing Morning Pages or\ntaking a short walk before work. Picture yourself sitting quietly in the early\nhours, pen in hand, letting your thoughts flow freely onto paper. Writing\ndeclutters your mind and sharpens your focus, readying you for creative and\ncritical thinking. Alternatively, envision stepping outside for a brisk walk,\nwhere the fresh air and gentle movement invigorate your body and clear your\nmind, replicating the psychological transition of commuting to an office.\n\nThese rituals are more than mere routines, whether enjoying a quiet cup of\ncoffee, engaging in reflective writing, or embracing the morning air on a walk.\nThey are acts of self-care that set the stage for a productive, focused, and\nfulfilling workday. **By deliberately starting your day with such practices, you\ncultivate a workspace that respects the balance between personal well-being and\nprofessional excellence**, inspiring productivity and a more profound sense of\nsatisfaction and achievement in your remote work journey.\n\nInvestment: free (unless your\n[morning ritual requires equipment](http://conradstoll.com/blog/2017/5/16/my-homebrew-espresso-morning-ritual))\n\n## 7. Incorporating Nature\n\nIntroducing nature into your workspace can significantly impact your\nconcentration and well-being. Adding indoor plants or arranging your desk to\nface an outdoor view can do wonders for your mood, purify the air, and reduce\nstress. Even if you don't have a window view, incorporating elements like\nlandscape photos or a small desktop fountain can still provide a calming effect.\nThis approach transforms your work area into a haven that promotes health,\ncreativity, and efficiency. It's a simple yet inspiring way to enhance your\ndaily work experience and create a healthier, more enjoyable, and productive\nenvironment.\n\nInvestment: $10-$40\n\n![MacBook pro beside green plant on the table](WFH_plants.webp)\n\n## 8. Connectivity Beyond Work\n\nMaintaining social connections is essential for remote workers to feel a sense\nof community. Regular coffee chats with colleagues, even virtually, can help\nbridge the gap between physical and virtual workspaces. This straightforward\nroutine fosters support, idea sharing, and workplace camaraderie, crucial for a\nbalanced and fulfilling work experience.\n\nInvestment: free\n\n## 9. Working with Your Body's Clock\n\nRecognizing the natural ebbs and flows of your body's productivity is crucial to\nworking smarter. If you, like me, experience a mental slump around 2 PM, taking\na break is better than forcing yourself to be productive. This can be a\ngame-changer. During this time, **I usually step outside with my dog, which\nboosts my energy and refreshes my mind, making the rest of the day more\nproductive and enjoyable**. This approach respects your natural rhythms, leading\nto more effective and satisfying work habits.\n\nInvestment: free\n\n## 10. Time Awareness\n\nEmbracing remote work often leads to blending personal and professional lives,\nmaking it challenging to distinguish between the two. Establishing clear\nboundaries and ensuring you take regular breaks is beneficial—it's essential for\npreventing burnout and sustaining high productivity levels. You create a more\nbalanced and fulfilling work environment by consciously delineating work hours\nand leisure time and prioritizing moments of rest throughout the day. This\ndeliberate structuring of your day safeguards your well-being, enhances your\nwork quality, and ultimately contributes to a more satisfying and productive\nremote work experience.\n\n## 11. Documentation is Key\n\nIn remote environments, where face-to-face interactions are replaced by digital\ncommunication, keeping detailed records of meetings and decisions becomes even\nmore critical. **The absence of physical presence can lead to misunderstandings\nor overlooked details, making it harder to ensure everyone is on the same\npage.** Detailed records serve as a common ground for all team members,\nregardless of location. They help bridge the gap created by remote work,\nensuring that every discussion, decision, and nuance is captured and accessible.\nThis practice fosters transparency, accountability, and continuity, allowing\nteams to stay aligned, informed, and engaged. It's not just about preventing\ninformation loss but empowering a distributed team to collaborate effectively,\nmaintain momentum, and drive forward with a unified vision, even when miles\napart.\n\nInvestment: $10/mo-$45/mo\n\nTools: Notion, Obsidian, Notes, Sonix, Notta, Otter\n\n## 12. Maintaining a Professional Routine\n\nFor many of us, getting ready for work involves more than just personal hygiene\nand dressing up—it's also a mental transition that helps us shift from rest mode\nto productivity and focus. By embracing this ritual, we can significantly\nenhance our work readiness, giving our day a sense of purpose and clarity. It's\nnot just about the clothes we wear or the water that refreshes us, but the\nintentional switch we make that sets the tone for a day filled with\naccomplishments and professional satisfaction. Investment: free\n\n## 13. Physical Well-being\n\nStanding desks are essential for remote workers as they offer a healthier, more\ndynamic workspace. They allow for an easy transition between standing and\nsitting, which can reduce the risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle, such\nas musculoskeletal discomfort. Standing desks enhance productivity and focus by\nboosting circulation, vital for brain function and concentration. Users who opt\nfor standing desks experience increased productivity due to the flexibility to\nchange positions. Modern standing desks come with adjustable features that allow\nfor personalized comfort, promoting proper posture and contributing to overall\nhealth by managing weight and reducing chronic disease risks. Adopting a\nstanding desk is wise to improve your remote work setup and health. You can find\naffordable standing desks starting at around $120. You can also opt for a\nstanding desk converter starting at $90.\n\nInvestment: $90-$3000\n\nIncorporating a daily stretching routine into your remote work schedule can\nsignificantly reduce the adverse effects of prolonged sitting. Regular\nstretching helps relieve muscle tension and improves flexibility, circulation,\nand overall health, which decreases the risk of injuries from static postures.\nTaking a few minutes each hour to do targeted stretches boosts muscle\nactivation, blood flow, energy levels, and mental clarity, enhancing work\nperformance and productivity. It also provides a mental break, promoting\nrelaxation, mindfulness, and a healthier work-life balance. When combined with a\nstanding desk, these practices offer a comprehensive approach to ergonomic\nhealth, combating the sedentary lifestyle of remote work and fostering a\ndynamic, health-conscious work environment.\n\nInvestment: free\n\n## 14. Creating Your Ideal Workspace\n\nA clear understanding of what you need from your workspace is essential for\nsucceeding in remote work. For me, it's all about keeping the area clutter-free,\nensuring good lighting, and having enough whiteboard space. These essentials can\ntransform a simple workspace into a productivity powerhouse. It's not just about\nfinding a corner to work in; **it's about creating a space that suits your\nunique work style**. Whether you prefer a dedicated office that keeps the rest\nof your life separate or a flexible spot that blends work with comfort, the\nright environment can significantly impact your focus, creativity, and overall\njob satisfaction. Tailoring your workspace to your needs is not just a matter of\npreference; it's a strategic move toward sustainable success in the remote\nworking world. It ensures you remain inspired, efficient, and on track with your\ngoals.\n\nInvestment: Ongoing\n\n### 14-B. Continuous Workspace Enhancement\n\nYour workspace is a crucial aspect of your remote work life, and it deserves\nregular consideration and improvements to align with your evolving career.\nWhether you choose to refresh it annually or commemorate a new job milestone,\nsmall yet impactful upgrades can significantly enhance your work environment\nand, as a result, boost your productivity and job satisfaction.\n\nMake it a habit to assess and enhance your workspace, using significant career\nmoments as opportunities for meaningful upgrades. This can include ergonomic\nimprovements, technology updates, or personalized decor that inspires and\nmotivates you.\n\nInvestment: Ongoing\n\n---\n\nRemote work provides numerous advantages but necessitates a purposeful approach\nto establish a productive work atmosphere. By implementing these tactics, remote\nworkers can increase their productivity, well-being, and job satisfaction. As\nthe work environment evolves, adapting and refining your home office setup will\nremain crucial in achieving professional success.\n\n## Further reading\n\n- https://www.scarbir.com/guide/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-for-phone-calls\n- https://www.hanselman.com/blog/is-daddy-on-a-call-a-busylight-presence-indicator-for-lync-for-my-home-office\n- https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/pomodoro-technique\n- https://ergoglobal.com/ten-benefits-of-plants-in-the-office-and-home-workspace/\n- [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185226/#:~:text=Working from home may allow,the same time each morning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185226/#:~:text=Working%20from%20home%20may%20allow,the%20same%20time%20each%20morning).\n- https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-benefits-of-a-standing-desk#TOC_TITLE_HDR_10\n- https://zapier.com/blog/best-transcription-apps/\n\n## Mentioned Products\n\n\u003Caside>\n  ☝ These are simply links for reference.

Most teams hit three walls: communication, coordination, and culture. Here''s how to break through.","scaling-engineering-walls.webp","Many engineering teams thinks their chaos is unique. (Spoiler: It's not).\n\nBetween 5 and 50 engineers, most companies slam into a few predictable walls. **The exact numbers vary.** Remote teams hit them earlier, colocated ones later. But the patterns repeat often enough to be worth watching for.\n\n![Minimalist photo of tall concrete walls, symbolizing barriers teams face as they grow from 5 to 50 engineers.](scaling-engineering-walls.webp)\n\nThink of this less as precise math and more as a field guide of common inflection points. The walls might appear at 8 or 15, 30 or 50, but they will appear. **The earlier you spot them, the faster you can break through.**\n\n## Wall #1: The Communication Wall (often ~8–15 engineers)\n\nAt five people, nobody needs process. At eight, if you are remote, cracks start showing. At fifteen, even colocated teams feel it.\n\n**This is the point where shared awareness collapses.** Everyone used to know everything. Now, product-impacting decisions happen in parallel, but not always in alignment.\n\n> It feels like: *\"Wait, why does onboarding position a feature one way, while the dashboard positions it another way?\"*\n\n**The real danger isn't duplication, it's divergence.** Different teams make product choices that unintentionally pull the experience in opposite directions. Maybe one team optimizes sign-up flow for conversion while another optimizes onboarding for clarity, and suddenly the two don't fit together.\n\nWhy it's different from coordination: **Communication is about awareness.** Even knowing these decisions are happening. Coordination (the next wall) is about executing smoothly once you have that awareness.\n\nClassic symptom: The org ends up with conflicting user experiences, because product choices were made in isolation.\n\nHow to break through:\n\n- Establish lightweight rituals: daily standups, weekly updates, decision logs.\n- **Over-document decisions**, even ones that feel obvious.\n- Repeat key messages until you feel like a broken record, because that is usually when they are actually landing.\n\n## Wall #2: The Coordination Wall (often ~20–30 engineers)\n\nOkay, everyone's aware. Now comes the harder part: working together without stepping on each other's toes.\n\nThis wall shows up once you have multiple teams. Dependencies multiply. Priorities collide. **You’re not shipping slower because of bad code, but because moving the org takes choreography.**\n\nIt feels like: *\"We wrote the code in a week. It took a month to unblock, review, and ship it.\"*\n\nWhy it happens:\n\n- The first management layers appear: tech leads, \u003Cabbr title=\"Engineering Managers\">EMs\u003C/abbr>. Suddenly, not everyone reports to the founder\n- Without clear ownership, teams block each other\n- Rapid hiring accelerates the pain. Triple headcount in six months, and this wall hits like a freight train\n\nClassic symptom: Everyone knows a migration or shared system is a blocker, but nobody owns driving it forward.\n\nHow to break through:\n\n- Create small, autonomous teams with clear ownership\n- Assign a single-threaded leader per project, one owner not three co-owners\n- Add process gradually. Start with the lightest version that works:\n    - \u003Cabbr title=\"Request for Comments\">RFCs\u003C/abbr> for cross-team decisions\n    - Quarterly or biannual planning (scaled to your pace)\n    - A visible dependency board so surprises don't pile up late\n\n**Think of communication as knowing where the traffic lights are, and coordination as actually getting cars through the intersection without collisions.**\n\n## Wall #3: The Culture Wall (becomes unavoidable ~40+ engineers)\n\nCulture drift does not wait until 40. In my experience, the first hints show up around 15 to 20 people, especially once you add managers or contractors. By 40 it is no longer optional. **You either steer culture actively or it fragments on its own.**\n\nNew hires do not know the inside jokes or the founding stories. Different teams begin to feel like distinct subcultures, sometimes pulling in different directions. Early employees often feel like they are losing the family vibe they helped create. Later employees sometimes feel like they are treated as second class, joining a product and culture that others built before them.\n\nIt feels like: *\"Early employees miss the family they built, while later employees feel like they’ll never fully belong.\"*\n\nWhy it happens:\n\n- Shared context no longer scales socially.\n- Rapid hiring outpaces cultural absorption.\n- Distributed teams amplify drift if values are not codified.\n\nClassic symptom: Different groups form their own norms and expectations, which eventually clash.\n\nHow to break through:\n\n- Write down your values, but don't stop there.\n- Decide who owns culture: founders set direction, managers model it daily, and by ~50+ People/\u003Cabbr title=\"Human Resources\">HR\u003C/abbr> reinforces it in hiring, onboarding, and promotions.\n- Accept that culture evolves. **The goal is not to freeze it, but to guide it so it grows in line with your mission**.\n\n## Breaking Through\n\nBetween 5 and 50 engineers, most teams hit three walls:\n\n- Communication: awareness breaks down.\n- Coordination: execution slows down despite awareness.\n- Culture: drift becomes unavoidable if left unmanaged.\n\nThe timing depends on how you grow: fast vs. slow, remote vs. colocated, founder-led vs. manager-heavy. But the patterns repeat.\n\nEach wall is just proof you've grown, and an invitation to level up how you work.\n\n**The best teams don't avoid the walls. They see them coming, and they level up fast enough to break through.**\n\nSo, which wall is your team facing right now?","src/content/blog/scaling-engineering-teams-walls.mdx","c1e014e490752fdf","rethink-outbuild-5-mindset-shifts-startup-success",{"id":524,"data":526,"body":532,"filePath":533,"digest":534,"deferredRender":27},{"title":527,"date":528,"tags":529,"description":530,"image":531,"draft":22,"readingTime":162},"Rethink to Outbuild: 5 Mindset Shifts for Startup Success in the Build vs. Buy Debate",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.236Z"],[133,280,279],"Discover the critical mindset shifts every entrepreneur needs to make in the build vs. buy debate.

In the rapid pace of startup life, stopping and considering\nwhether an existing solution can accelerate your journey is crucial. Before\ncommitting to building, evaluate if there's a route already cleared and ready\nfor you; just a call (or click) away. In the race to innovate, the most\nsuccessful often win by knowing when to sprint and when catching a ride is the\nsmarter move.\n\n## 2. Value Time as Your Premier Currency:\n\n### Old Thinking:\n\nPinching pennies is paramount; every expense is scrutinized.\n\n### New Mindset:\n\n**Time is the ultimate startup currency.** Consider it the gold reserve in your\nvault — precious, finite, and what determines your venture's wealth. It's not\njust about spending less money but investing time wisely to yield the most\nsignificant returns. Before making any decision, weigh the time cost as heavily\nas financial ones, ensuring that each minute is spent moving you closer to your\ngoals, not just saving dollars.\n\n## 3. Cultivate an Ecosystem Mindset:\n\n### Old Thinking:\n\nIf we need it, we should build it.\n\n### New Mindset:\n\nNo startup is an island. Embrace the ecosystem of tools and services already\navailable. Think of it like attending a potluck dinner. Why spend hours cooking\nwhen you can bring the best pie from the bakery down the street? It's about\ncontributing with intelligent choices, not just hard work. By effectively\nselecting and integrating existing solutions, you save time and add value\nefficiently, ensuring you're always bringing something delightful.\n\n## 4. Prioritize Adaptability Over Perfection:\n\n### Old Thinking:\n\nThe solution must meet all our needs precisely as envisioned.\n\n### New Mindset:\n\n**Adaptability trumps perfection.** Think of it as choosing the right pair of\nshoes for a hike. You don't need the most high-tech, feature-packed boots to\nenjoy the trail; you need something reliable and fit for the purpose. Similarly,\nseek solutions good enough for your business goals—effective, efficient, and\nready to go the distance without the unnecessary bells and whistles. After all,\nthe best tool is the one that gets you moving toward your destination, not the\nshiniest one in the store.\n\n## 5. Learn the Art of Good Enough:\n\n### Old Thinking:\n\nEverything we build should be a masterpiece.\n\n### New Mindset:\n\n**Embrace 'good enough' for non-core functions.** Not every tool or system needs\nto be a Sistine Chapel ceiling. Sometimes, a well-painted bedroom wall is all\nyou need to move on to the next big thing.\n\n---\n\nAs entrepreneurs, we're drawn to challenges, thriving on the thrill of solving\ncomplex problems. But only some challenges are worth the chase. When we chose\nthe grand adventure of creating a business (or joining someone on that journey),\nwe also decided to be selective, focusing our energy on battles that advance our\nmission. These five mindset shifts remind us to approach each build vs. buy\ndecision with wisdom and discernment. It's not about taking on every problem;\nit's about strategically conquering the right ones that lead to impactful and\nefficient success. As you continue this journey, remember to embrace the\nchallenges that matter, delegate or bypass those that don't, and always steer\nyour venture towards more intelligent, sustainable growth. Here's to building a\nbusiness and a legacy of wise decisions and strategic victories.","src/content/blog/rethink-outbuild-5-mindset-shifts-startup-success.mdx","b2f6f1364bbaeaf3","seed-ios-simulator-with-contacts-for-testing",{"id":535,"data":537,"body":544,"filePath":545,"digest":546,"deferredRender":27},{"title":538,"date":539,"tags":540,"description":542,"image":543,"draft":22,"readingTime":162},"Seed iOS Simulator with Contacts for Testing",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.236Z"],[541,220],"ios","How to seed the iOS simulator with thousands of contacts to stress-test your hybrid app.","seed-ios-simulator.webp","Recently I was tasked with building a custom contacts display/picker for iOS\nusing JavaScript. I needed a way to test my code against a large contacts base\nto ensure good performance. Unfortunately there didn't seem to be any easy\nsolution.\n\n![A developer testing an iOS app featuring an NFT on a smartphone, with the app's code and user interface displayed on the computer screen in the background.](seed-ios-simulator.webp)\n\nOf the solutions I found, only one actually worked, but it was limited to 200\ncontacts which didn't put enough stress on my code. If all you need is 200, you\ncan find it here: [DummyContacts][dummy].\n\nI came across an article by [Adam Harris][adam] who had devised a [clever\nway][20000] to build a VCard with 20,000 contacts. He even offers that VCard for\ndownload. Unfortunately, importing 20,000 contacts locked up my simulator.\n\n**Below I have outlined how I created a 2000 contact VCard for import** (heavily\nbased off of Adam's work). Full Plunkr can be found [here][plunkr].\n\n> A full list of resources along with downloadable VCards containing various\n> amounts of contacts will be available for download at the end of this article.\n\n## Generate a JSON array full of contacts\n\nLuckily there is a great online tool for generating objects with random data\ncalled [JSON Generator][json]. You can create an object template using a few\ncustom tags to generate random names/numbers/etc.\n\nHere is the [template][template] I used:\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/benjamincharity/c295aea01a74b036fec0.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nI won't dive into the template here. If you are curious about the structure of\nthe object, check out Adam's article (linked above). Also, the custom tags are\nexplained by the help section on the JSON Generator website.\n\nThe primary changes between Adam's template and my own is:\n\n1. All phone numbers are 'fake' e.g., (638) 555-8374\n2. All emails are 'fake' e.g., user@gmail9999.com\n3. `n.families` & `n.givens` are strings rather than arrays\n\n> Note: There seems to be a limit of about 100 that the generator will output in\n> one run, so I had to run it several times to copy enough output.\n\nThis is what the template and results would look like:\n\n![A screenshot of generator code for iOS](generatorExample_ta2kup.png)\n\n## Convert the array into a VCard text file\n\nAn open source project called [VCard to JSON][vcard] will allow us to convert a\ncontacts object into the VCard format.\n\n**NOTE:** This library expects `n.families` and `n.givens` to contain arrays.\nHowever, at the time of this writing, the JSON Generator outputs the same name\nover and over again across all objects when inside an array. You can find a\nmodified version of this library as part of the [full gist][fullGist] of this\nprocess.\n\n**NOTE #2:** For some reason, the output always seems to have `undefined` at the\nbeginning. I didn't have the time to debug it, so in the Plunkr, I am simply\nstripping out the first 9 characters of the string. Hacky, but it gets it done.\nIf anyone takes the time to find a fix, I'll be more than happy to update the\nPlunkr and this article.\n\n## Tie it all together\n\nI created a [plunkr][plunkr] to tie everything together. Simply replace the\ncontents of `contacts.js` with your array of contacts, click 'Create Link' which\nwill create a text file containing all the VCard formatted contacts. Finally,\nclick 'download' to download the file.\n\n## Import the contacts\n\nNow we simply need to open the Contacts' application in the simulator and drop\nthe downloaded vcf file onto it. Depending on how many contacts you are\nimporting, it may take a few minutes. (1000 was quite fast though)\n\n---\n\n##### Resources\n\n- [Project Plunkr][plunkr]\n- [Gist with all project files][fullGist]\n- [JSON Generator template][template]\n- [VCard to JSON library][vcard]\n- [VCard with 1,000 contacts](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts0-1000.vcf)\n- [VCard with 1,000 (different) contacts](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1000-2000.vcf)\n- [Zip of all VCards](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/ContactsVCards.zip)\n\n##### Batches of 100 contacts per VCard:\n\n- [VCard 1-100](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1-100.vcf)\n- [VCard 101-200](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts101-200.vcf)\n- [VCard 201-300](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts201-300.vcf)\n- [VCard 301-400](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts301-400.vcf)\n- [VCard 401-500](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts401-500.vcf)\n- [VCard 501-600](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts501-600.vcf)\n- [VCard 601-700](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts601-700.vcf)\n- [VCard 701-800](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts701-800.vcf)\n- [VCard 801-900](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts801-900.vcf)\n- [VCard 901-1000](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts901-1000.vcf)\n- [VCard 1001-1100](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1001-1100.vcf)\n- [VCard 1101-1200](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1101-1200.vcf)\n- [VCard 1201-1300](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1201-1300.vcf)\n- [VCard 1301-1400](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1301-1400.vcf)\n- [VCard 1401-1500](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1401-1500.vcf)\n- [VCard 1501-1600](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1501-1600.vcf)\n- [VCard 1601-1700](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1601-1700.vcf)\n- [VCard 1701-1800](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1701-1800.vcf)\n- [VCard 1801-1900](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1801-1900.vcf)\n- [VCard 1901-2000](https://cdn.benjamincharity.com/vcards/contacts1901-2000.vcf)\n\n[plunkr]: https://plnkr.co/edit/0Q1gz3BLocaIFg2B0rVH?p=preview\n[template]: https://gist.github.com/benjamincharity/c295aea01a74b036fec0\n[fullGist]: https://gist.github.com/benjamincharity/ac35ac288552feee349a\n[json]: https://next.json-generator.com/\n[vcard]: https://github.com/andrewppace/vcard-json\n[adam]: https://github.com/aharris88\n[20000]:\n  https://www.adamwadeharris.com/heres-how-i-created-20000-fake-contacts-on-the-iphone/\n[dummy]: https://github.com/Janak-Nirmal/DummyContacts","src/content/blog/seed-ios-simulator-with-contacts-for-testing.mdx","5092c7010e93455f","slack-channel-evolution-guide-organizational-growth",{"id":547,"data":549,"body":556,"filePath":557,"digest":558,"deferredRender":27},{"title":550,"date":551,"tags":552,"description":554,"image":555,"draft":22,"readingTime":198},"Slack Channel Evolution: A Guide for Organizational Growth",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.237Z"],[553,133,18],"communication","Discover a practical roadmap for Slack channel organization to facilitate seamless company growth. Learn when and how to create channels that align with your...","slack-channel-evolution.webp","Welcome to the dynamic journey of organizational growth! As we embark on this\nadventure, it’s essential to remember that the path we’re outlining is a broad\nblueprint, not a one-size-fits-all roadmap. Every company is unique, with its\nown set of experiences and milestones. While we provide approximate employee\ncounts as signposts, they serve more as a guide than a rigid framework, helping\nus anticipate and plan for the evolving needs of our organization.\n\n![A person multitasks using Slack on a laptop and a mobile phone in a cafe setting, managing communications across multiple devices.](slack-channel-evolution.webp)\n\n**Early adoption of a structured approach is key. By establishing a clear\norganizational framework from the start, we can avoid the complexities of\nrestructuring and renaming down the line.** This proactive planning isn’t just\nabout maintaining order and empowerment. When our team understands the structure\nof our company information, they gain clarity and confidence. They become better\nequipped to recognize when a new channel is needed and how to effectively\norganize it, ensuring that our communication remains as streamlined and\nefficient as our operations.\n\nAs we grow and scale, **this structure will be our backbone, supporting us in\nadapting to change, embracing new challenges, and seizing opportunities with\nagility and insight.**\n\n## Founding\n\n_0-5 people_\n\nDuring this phase, most activities are conducted within three communication\nchannels. While some individuals might opt for a single-channel approach at this\npoint, it is challenging if there's a strict policy of consistently utilizing\nthreads. In the initial stages, I frequently engage in multiple simultaneous\nconversations, and managing notifications becomes more convenient in this\nmanner. Here, you can begin to discern the initial elements of our\norganizational structure.\n\n- `#general`\n- `#dept-product`\n- `#dept-cs`\n\n## Startup\n\n_5-50 people_\n\nWe need to create more department-specific and general information channels at\nthis stage. With our growing team, we can also introduce some fun channels\ndedicated to pets and trips.\n\nSetting up a leadership channel for each department is crucial now. These\nchannels significantly shape how we work and the culture we build as a company.\n\nAs our projects involve people from different teams, we're starting to use\ntemporary, project-specific channels. We're also changing how we handle\nproduction incidents. We now have a starting point for any incident and a\nstructured way to create channels for each incident type. We've added a new bot\nprefix to help manage automated notifications from different sources like\ndeployments, support, and marketing.\n\n**It's important to encourage everyone to mute channels by default as we move\nforward.** You can jump into a channel if you want to, but you won't get\nconstant notifications for every message. This helps us stay focused.\n\nTo keep things organized, use pins and channel info to store important\ninformation like who's in charge of a channel and links to relevant team or\nproject documents.\n\nConsider using an asynchronous check-in process. If we don't have a dedicated\ntool for it, we can use Slack automation to facilitate weekly and daily\ncheck-ins. This will help us stay on top of project updates and priorities.\n\n- `#dept-people-ops` - A channel for HR-related teams and talk.\n- `#dept-eng` At this point, it is time to split from product to help keep\n  conversations focused\n- `#dept-marketing` - Around this time, it's beneficial to provide a space for\n  those managing marketing roles, even if you don't have a dedicated team.\n- `#fun-furry-friends` - Pets!\n- `#fun-trips` - Celebrate time off and don’t limit it to vacations. Even a day\n  trip counts!\n- Project-specific channels - `#proj-sso`\n- `#leadership-panel` - for the leaders of each department\n- `#fun-hobbies` - Everything from underwater soap carving to competitive\n  knitting.\n- `#situation-room` - Where people convene when things go wrong.\n- Incident response channels - `#ir-database-jan24`\n- `#random` or `#water-cooler` - Simple chat with no topic.\n- `#you-are-awesome` - A place to recognize team members.\n- `#announcements` - Company-wide announcements.\n- Automated channels: `#bot-github`, `#bot-salesforce`\n\n## Scale-up\n\n_50-300 people_\n\nDevOps is evolving into a distinct entity as we progress, prompting us to\nseparate it from the Engineering channel. Similarly, we're detaching Design from\nthe Product channel. **The product will continue to focus on high-level matters\nand important updates while the more tactical aspects shift to Design.**\n\nAlong this journey, we'll reach a point where introducing regional channels\nbecomes valuable. This necessity varies, as a company with 50 employees across\nthree cities may find it helpful, whereas one spread across 30+ cities might\nnot.\n\nDuring this stage, we'll also need to refine departmental conversations,\nenabling the introduction of team and guild channels. While guild and department\nchannels overlap, guild channels discuss the guild's activities. Therefore,\nwhile product design and organization discussions occur in the department-design\nchannel, designers can connect with peers across teams and projects,\nfacilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration.\n\nAs we move forward, the need for dedicated IT support arises, leading us to\ncreate a dedicated channel. Integrating your knowledge base with Slack would be\nhighly beneficial if you still need to implement it.\n\n- `#dept-dev-ops` - Split from engineering.\n- `#it` - General IT support.\n- `#dept-design` - Split from product.\n- Regional channels - `#loc-atlanta`, `#geo-scranton`\n- Team or pod channels - `#team-voltron`\n- Guild channels - `#guild-design`\n\n## Expansion\n\n_♾️_\n\nDuring the Expansion stage, the primary structural foundation has been laid, and\nthe emphasis now lies on extending operations and capabilities within the\nestablished framework. **It marks a phase where the organization seeks to\nmaximize its potential and grow effectively.** This stage is characterized by a\nconcerted effort to harness the existing structure for expansion and\ndevelopment.\n\n## Bonus\n\nAdding custom emojis and GIFs can be a game-changer for building a vibrant\ncompany culture. They inject fun and personality into our conversations, making\nwork more enjoyable. Plus, they let us express ourselves uniquely, bringing the\nteam closer and showcasing our unique identity.\n\n---\n\nAs we conclude this discussion, it's crucial to highlight a key point: while our\nstructured approach to organization may seem ambitious early on, it's a\nstrategic investment in our long-term success. **Questions about our\norganizational structure and channel management aren't just recurring; they're\nfundamental to our journey toward growth and excellence.** By establishing a\nsolid foundation now, we're not merely organizing for the present but laying the\ngroundwork for our future, enabling us to concentrate on what truly\nmatters—innovation, execution, and delivering value to our customers. Just like\na sturdy tree, our strength doesn't only come from visible branches but from\ndeep and robust roots. Let's nurture these roots, empowering ourselves to reach\nnew heights and unlock our full potential as senior leaders.","src/content/blog/slack-channel-evolution-guide-organizational-growth.mdx","cfaf0f235e69f676","show-the-finder-status-bar-in-os-x-10-8-and-later",{"id":559,"data":561,"body":567,"filePath":568,"digest":569,"deferredRender":27},{"title":562,"date":563,"tags":564,"description":566,"draft":22,"readingTime":55},"Show the Finder Status Bar in OSX 10.8 and Later",["Date","2025-10-02T01:50:11.237Z"],[565],"osx","How to quickly toggle the status bar on or off inside Finder.","The Finder status bar offered a quick reference to how many files/folders\nexisted in the current directory along with your hard-drive's available space.\n\nFinder, _without_ the status bar:\n![A screenshot of the OSX finder screen shows that no bottom bar is visible.](withoutStatusBar_bn9cir.webp)\n\nFinder, _with_ the status bar:\n![A screenshot of the OSX finder screen showing the bottom bar.](withStatusBar_bo7zyn.webp)\n\nIt turns out that rather than removing it, Apple simply defaulted it to hidden\n(at least since 10.8).\n\nWith Finder focused, go to `View > Show Status Bar`.

The tricky part is that\n**while Amazon offers handy dropdowns with values for both `content-type` and\n`content-encoding`, the options we need are not in the lists by default.** So it\ncomes across as though those options are not valid. But, we are rebels and don't\ncare.

Now, for the value of `content-type` input\n`text/css`, `text/js` or `text/html` to match the type of gzipped file you have.\nNext we need the `content-encoding` key. Add the value `gzip`.\n\nThat's it! Your files should now load correctly and happiness will flow over the\nearth.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1]: Yeah, I know this is probably not true.

Pay it down.\n\nAnd sure, unmanaged debt will grind you to a halt. But here's the thing nobody tells you:\n\n**Technical debt isn't rot. It's momentum, if you manage it right.**\n\n![Hot air balloon rising at golden hour with sandbags visible on the basket, symbolizing balance, control, and steady momentum.](technical-debt-momentum.webp)\n\n## My mistake: excellence too early\n\nI'll admit it. I was guilty of over-engineering early systems.\n\nI obsessed over abstractions, design patterns, and pristine code long before the business needed that level of polish.\n\nIt felt like excellence.\n\nIn reality, it slowed us down. I spent weeks making something elegant when we could have shipped a rougher version and tested the market. The business didn't get healthier. The product didn't get stronger. We just burned cycles.\n\n**Avoiding debt completely was its own kind of debt.** Invisible, but just as costly.\n\n## When technical debt is actually an asset\n\nDebt buys speed. It lets you:\n\n- Ship features faster\n- Run experiments you would never justify if they took six months\n- Gather customer feedback while it still matters\n\nThe trap is thinking \"clean code now\" is always better. Sometimes what your team really needs is velocity, not purity.\n\n**The question isn't whether to take on debt. It's whether you are taking on debt that expands future options or collapses them.**\n\n## A framework CFOs already understand\n\nCFOs deal with this every day. They don't avoid financial debt. They manage it. They ask:\n\n- What is the principal? (the shortcut we are taking)\n- What is the interest? (the cost of carrying it forward: slower dev, bugs, context loss)\n- What is the risk of default? (the moment the debt cripples us)\n\nOnce I started thinking about technical debt this way, conversations across the business got a lot easier. Suddenly engineering wasn't arguing about code quality. We were making trade-offs in the same language everyone already uses.\n\nMy rule of thumb:\n\n1. What is the acceleration benefit?\n2. What is the interest cost over time?\n3. What is the default risk if we ignore it?\n\nIf you can't answer those, you are not making a strategic choice. You are just gambling.\n\n## Building a debt budget\n\nHere's where many teams get it wrong. They treat debt like a dirty secret.\n\nThe better approach is to build a budget.\n\n- Cap it. Agree on a percentage of roadmap time to service debt.\n- Make it visible. Dashboards, recurring reviews, burn-down tracking.\n- Pay it down intentionally. Don't wait for a crisis. Plan repayment when the business can afford it.\n\nOnce I shifted from avoiding all debt to budgeting for it, alignment with product and finance became smoother. Engineers stopped feeling guilty. The business stopped being surprised.\n\n## Why this matters more in 2025 and beyond\n\nAI is making it easier than ever to ship features at breakneck speed.

And let's be clear: pay has to be competitive. If you're under market, no career framework will save you. But once compensation is fair, it isn't the main reason engineers walk out the door. The data tells a clearer story: **internal mobility doubles retention**. Employees who can move up stay 5.4 years on average; those who can't leave in under three [[1]](#further-reading). That's the quiet math behind why your best engineers keep leaving.\n\n![Climbers connected by rope ascending a steep rock face.](rock-climbers.webp)\n\n## The hidden leak: juniors and mids\n\nAttrition isn't just about senior engineers with decades of experience. Juniors and mid-level engineers often leave as soon as another company offers them a promotion [[1]](#further-reading). And when they do, you don't just lose an individual. You lose all the ramp-up time, the team context they were absorbing, and the hours of senior mentorship invested in them.\n\nIt's a painful cycle. By the time an engineer is finally productive and confident, they're polishing their résumé for a \"Senior\" title elsewhere.\n\nLeaders can spot the warning signs: juniors who struggle for months before shipping something meaningful, which signals slow ramp and shaky confidence; mentors spread too thin to give hands-on support, which makes growth feel optional rather than expected; and mid-levels who can't clearly articulate what it takes to get to the next level, which is a sign the ladder isn't visible.\n\n## When \"flat\" hides the ladder\n\nFlat organizations feel egalitarian and flexible. That's appealing in a startup's early days because decisions are fast and hierarchy is minimal [[5]](#further-reading).\n\nThe consequence is subtle but damaging: **without visible levels or clear expectations, engineers feel stuck**. Promotions get tied to headcount rather than capability, and in many orgs the only way up is into management. That's not a path. It's a funnel. And it pushes great engineers out, even if they like the work.\n\n## Growth without chasing titles\n\nThe alternative is to decouple growth from promotions. Engineers don't need a new title every year, but they do need to see progress [[2]](#further-reading).\n\nWhen progress isn't visible, juniors assume they're falling behind, mids assume they're being overlooked, and seniors assume the only growth left is outside the company. That's how attrition builds quietly over time.\n\nGrowth tends to take three forms:\n\n- **Scope growth**: tackling bigger, messier, more ambiguous problems.\n- **Skill growth**: deepening technical expertise, leading incidents, learning new domains.\n- **Signal growth**: visibility, recognition, and impact across the organization.\n\nThe key is to pair these with recognition and, when appropriate, compensation. Otherwise scope creep starts to feel like exploitation.\n\n## Dual tracks, not a single funnel\n\nToo many organizations reward only those who step into management [[3]](#further-reading).\n\nThe result is predictable: engineers who want to keep building feel trapped, and engineers who don't want to manage people take management roles anyway just to grow. Both paths end in churn.\n\nThe stronger approach is to **publish parallel IC and Manager tracks with equal prestige** [[5]](#further-reading). At lower levels, promotions are about technical skill and execution. At higher levels, they emphasize impact and leadership. Both paths matter equally.\n\nYes, it can feel expensive to put Staff+ ICs on par with Directors. But compare that to the cost of losing a senior engineer: recruiting fees, three to six months of onboarding, and the productivity dip of the team around them. Retention is cheaper than replacement [[1]](#further-reading).\n\n> 💡 Retention is cheaper than replacement — for both customers and engineers.\n> \n> Acquiring a new customer can cost five to seven times more than retaining an existing one [[6]](#further-reading). The same math applies to talent. That's why companies build Customer Success functions, and it's why you need to invest in Engineer Success too.\n\n## Mentorship that scales with the team\n\nMentorship is one of the biggest drivers of retention [2], but one-on-one pairing doesn't scale once you pass 50 engineers.\n\nThe consequence is that juniors stagnate, mids plateau, and seniors burn out from being the default \"go-to\" mentor.\n\nThe answer is layered mentoring:\n\n- **Chapters**: discipline-based groups like UI, Mobile, or Infra that maintain standards [[5]](#further-reading).\n- **Guilds**: cross-cutting communities of practice, from performance to accessibility [[5]](#further-reading).\n- **Clinics**: recurring design reviews or incident debriefs where everyone learns [[5]](#further-reading).\n\nThis doesn't have to mean more meetings. Many of the best chapters operate through lightweight async docs, quarterly deep dives, or rotating facilitators. The manager's role stays career coach. The IC lead's role stays craft coach. Managers are still accountable for enabling mentoring structures, but they don't have to be the sole technical guide.\n\n## Cross-team communities: the Spotify model\n\nThe Spotify-inspired model of chapters and guilds has been over-hyped and badly copied [[5]](#further-reading).\n\nWhen done poorly, it creates process bloat and endless meetings. When done right, **horizontal groups with charters and lightweight maintainers give engineers chances to lead outside their immediate team**. That autonomy builds engagement, spreads knowledge, and creates a sense of progression without needing to shuffle titles.\n\nThe lesson isn't \"copy Spotify.\" It's \"adapt the idea to your org's size and culture.\n\n## Making the ladder visible\n\nThe simplest move most leaders skip? Publish the ladder [[1]](#further-reading).\n\nWithout it, engineers rely on rumors, and promotions feel arbitrary. With it, expectations become transparent, and progress feels attainable. A single one-pager that spells out what \"good\" looks like at each level, shows example artifacts like design docs or postmortems, and maps compensation to levels is often enough.\n\n## Proof beats perks\n\nPerks are nice, but proof wins. The data is clear:\n\n- Companies that excel at internal mobility retain employees **twice as long** (5.4 years vs. 2.9) [[1]](#further-reading).\n- Employees who learn skills on the job show **7% higher three-year retention** [[2]](#further-reading).\n- Only **one in five developers** reported being happy at work in 2024 [[3]](#further-reading).\n- U.S. employee engagement hit a **10-year low in 2024**, with only **31% engaged** [[4]](#further-reading).\n\nThe common thread? Money wasn't the reason. Career growth and visibility were.\n\n## What you can do this quarter\n\nStart small but visible. You don't need to launch everything at once. Even one step makes a difference.\n\n> ✅ If you only do one thing this quarter: publish your ladder.\n> \n> A single one-pager that shows levels, expectations, and example artifacts does more for retention than any perk you could roll out. It gives engineers proof there's a path forward, not just vague promises.\n\nFrom there, you can layer in additional moves:\n\n1. Launch a couple of chapters, starting with UI or Infra, with a Staff-level IC in a 90-day maintainer role [[5]](#further-reading).\n2. Open one rotational slot per quarter with no title change required [[2]](#further-reading).\n3. Replace ad-hoc mentoring with a weekly craft clinic or a monthly architecture review [[5]](#further-reading).\n4. Add \"stay interviews\" to manager routines. Ask engineers about scope, skills, and signal growth [[4]](#further-reading).\n5. Track three metrics: internal transfer rate, percentage of mids with named mentors, and time-to-first cross-team win [[1]](#further-reading).\n\nNone of these require a giant reorg. They're lightweight moves that signal progress.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nHybrid work raises the bar for visible ladders and structured rotations [[1]](#further-reading). And AI is already shortening the half-life of skills [[2]](#further-reading). A few years ago, frontend engineers were debating React versus Angular. Today, they're debating how much of their test suite AI should generate. That pace isn't slowing down.\n\nThe companies that invest here will keep their best engineers longer. The ones that don't will train talent for someone else's promotion [[2]](#further-reading).\n\n**People don't leave for money. They leave when they can't see a future. Show them the path, make it real, and they'll walk it with you instead of away from you.**\n\n## Further Reading\n\n1.

But here’s the problem: the world we design for is messy. From\ndiverse languages to the endless variety of screen sizes, rigid character limits\ndon’t scale. Worse, they often lead to usability and accessibility issues,\nleaving users frustrated and your product looking inflexible.\n\nAnd let’s be honest—**truncating text is rarely a solution with the customer in\nmind**. More often than not, it’s about making the UI look “pretty” or adhering\nto a specific design aesthetic. While a clean layout is important, prioritizing\naesthetics over usability ends up doing a disservice to your users. The goal of\na UI is to serve your audience, not to cram content into a box for the sake of\nvisual tidiness.\n\n![Text spilling out of a computer monitor.](text-truncation-hero.webp)\n\nLet’s unpack why character limits are usually a bad idea, when truncation might\nmake sense, and how to handle text constraints in a way that keeps everyone\nhappy.\n\n## The Problem with Character Limits\n\nCharacter limits might seem like a simple way to control your UI, but they often\ncreate more problems than they solve. Here’s why:\n\n### 1. There Are No Standard Screen Sizes\n\nWe live in a world of infinite devices. From phones to ultra-wide monitors and\neverything in between, the idea of designing for a single screen size is\noutdated. A character limit might work perfectly on one layout but overflow\nawkwardly on another or leave too much empty space.\n\n### 2. Languages Break Limits\n\nCharacter limits assume text will always take up the same amount of space.\nSpoiler: it doesn’t. English text may fit fine, but when translated into German,\nFrench, or Russian, a simple word like \"Settings\" (_Einstellungen_ in German)\ncan balloon and throw your design into chaos. Character limits also fail to\naccount for languages like Arabic, which expand differently due to contextual\nletter forms.\n\n### 3. Accessibility Suffers\n\nTruncated text often hides important context from users relying on screen\nreaders or assistive technologies. If there’s no way to access the full content,\nthese users are left with incomplete information, creating a significant barrier\nto access.\n\nEven if your UI provides a way to access the full text, such as a tooltip or\nmodal, you’re introducing an additional step for the user. Depending on the use\ncase, this extra interaction can add unnecessary friction to their workflow.\nImagine a scenario where a user with a screen reader is navigating a long list\nof truncated items—if they need to interact with each one individually to get\nthe full context, their experience becomes slow and frustrating.\n\nIn high-frequency or high-stakes workflows, like reviewing medical records,\nprocessing financial transactions, or searching for a specific document in a\nlong list, these extra steps can compound into significant inefficiencies. **A\ndesign that forces users to repeatedly “dig” for full information isn’t just\ninconvenient—it actively undermines productivity and can lead to errors or\noversights.**\n\nAccessibility isn’t just about making content available—it’s about making it\navailable _easily_. Truncating text without careful consideration can turn what\nshould be an intuitive experience into an obstacle course.\n\n## The UX Issues Caused by Character Limits\n\nLet’s look at how character limits impact real-world scenarios:\n\n### 1. Truncated Text With No Context\n\nImagine an e-commerce app where product titles are shortened to fit a card\nlayout. You end up with something like:\n\n- **Before:** _“Organic Cotton T-Shirt - Women’s Size Large”_\n- **After:** _“Organic Cotton T-Shirt -...”_\n\nUsers can’t tell if this is the product they’re looking for, forcing them to\nclick into every listing to find what they need. Not great.\n\n### 2. Inconsistent User Experiences Across Languages\n\nIn multilingual UIs, rigid character limits can make the same UI feel clean in\none language and completely broken in another. A button labeled \"Get Started\nworks well in English but doesn’t fit when translated to _Commencer maintenant_\nin French.\n\n### 3. Lost Opportunities for Responsive Design\n\nCharacter limits lock your content into a fixed mindset, ignoring how modern\ndesign needs to adapt. On a desktop layout, a headline might look oddly short,\nleaving wasted whitespace. On mobile, the same headline overflows, forcing\ntruncation.\n\n## When Truncation Makes Sense\n\nWhile truncation is rarely the ideal solution, there are situations where it’s a\npractical compromise. The key is to understand the context, ensure usability,\nand weigh the trade-offs carefully. Here are two examples where truncation can\nmake sense:\n\n### 1. Truncating Long Identifiers (e.g., UUIDs)\n\nGenerated identifiers like UUIDs are long and often difficult to parse visually.\nUsers rarely need to read the entire string but may need to verify specific\nportions. Truncation can make these identifiers more manageable while preserving\nenough context for users:\n\n- **Truncate in the Middle:** Keep the beginning and end visible for reference,\n  like `123e...89ab`.\n- **Truncate the Start (if Sequential):** If identifiers share a common prefix,\n  hiding the repetitive start and showing the differentiating end (e.g.,\n  `...456789ab`) can improve readability.\n\nThis approach reduces clutter without sacrificing functionality.\n\n### 2. Managing User-Generated Content: A Real-World Example\n\nHere’s an example from my own experience: I once worked on a piece of software\nwhere users had a habit of naming documents with absurdly long titles—50+ words,\nin some cases. While our ideal solution would have been to retrain users to\nadopt shorter, more descriptive titles, it wasn’t feasible. **Changing ingrained\nuser behavior wouldn’t have provided enough benefit to justify the effort, and\nforcing new limits would have risked alienating users.**\n\nInstead, we opted to truncate titles in the middle, showing the first and last\nportions of the text. Since the app was used exclusively on desktop (not\nmobile), this still allowed users to see over 20 words of the title—enough to\nlocate the document they needed. The design balanced usability for the users\nwhile maintaining consistency across the interface, which kept our product team\nsane.\n\n**Sometimes, real-world constraints force you to adapt.** While it wasn’t a\nperfect solution, it was the best compromise given the context and user\nbehavior.\n\n## Best Practices for Truncating Text\n\nIf you decide to truncate, follow these essential guidelines to maintain a\npositive user experience:\n\n### 1. Always Provide Access to Full Text\n\nUsers should always have a way to view the complete content. Some common\napproaches include:\n\n1. **Tooltips or Popovers:** Show the full text on hover or tap.\n2. **Expandable Text:** Use a `[...]` button to expand the truncated content in\n   place or in a modal.\n\n### 2. Ensure Accessibility\n\nTruncation should never block screen reader users or assistive technologies:\n\n- Use an **`aria-label`** to include the full content.\n- Alternatively, include the full text in a visually hidden element and\n  reference it with **`aria-describedby`**.\n\n### 3. Preserve Full Text for Searching and Filtering\n\nWhen truncating identifiers like UUIDs, **truncate the display, not the actual\ndata**. This ensures users can still search, filter, or copy-paste the complete\ninformation. Avoid APIs that truncate text before returning it—this almost\nalways creates issues for both developers and users.\n\n## Truncation: Almost Always the Wrong Choice\n\nWhile truncation might occasionally make sense, it’s usually the wrong solution.\nHere’s why:\n\n1. **You’re Designing for Limitations, Not Possibilities** Truncating content\n   assumes your design is static. But modern UIs should be dynamic, adapting to\n   various screen sizes, languages, and contexts. Why force content to fit into\n   a box when you can make the box fit the content?\n2. **It Creates Hidden Complexity** Truncating text adds extra layers of UX\n   complexity. Users need tooltips, modals, or other mechanisms to access the\n   full content. This makes your design harder to use and more challenging to\n   maintain.\n3. **It Fails to Solve the Underlying Problem** If content feels too long,\n   consider rethinking your layout or interaction model. Can the information be\n   grouped or segmented differently? Could you prioritize key details and hide\n   less critical information by default?\n\nThe best solution is often not to truncate but to design flexibly, allowing\ncontent to breathe and adapt.\n\n## Final Thoughts: Truncate Wisely, Design Smarter\n\nEnforcing character limits or truncating text should never be your default\napproach. Instead, **focus on designing UIs that scale gracefully—across\ndevices, languages, and use cases**. When truncation is necessary, implement it\nthoughtfully, with clear access to the full content and accessibility in mind.\n\n## Further reading\n\n- [Another Stab at Truncated Text](https://css-tricks.com/another-stab-at-truncated-text/)\n  by Geoff Graham.\n- [Taming Long Text: The Art of Truncation with CSS](https://medium.com/@tejeswar_79802/taming-long-text-the-art-of-truncation-with-css-499e33a7276e)\n  by Tejeswar Reddy","src/content/blog/why-character-limits-hurt-ux.mdx","8deb0e1fd6c3af38"]
